LifeProTips,l9gfqu,LPT: handle your pets how they’ll be handled at vet checkups from the start,"Handle their feet, legs, face, ears, neck, tail, everything. Get them used to being laid down on their side physically, not just taught a command (they tend to not listen when they hurt and are nervous and don’t know the person asking). Look up common restraint positions and get them used to pressure on those spots (sitting behind, arm around jaw, hand holding leg; sitting and having head held slightly up and looking just to the side). If possible, get them used to the sound of hair clippers even if you don’t use it on them. 

A lot of times, especially with puppies (in my experience, can’t speak for raising kittens), even if they’re acting like they’re getting murdered/will get their revenge on you when you touch their feet or hold them, given enough repetitions they’ll get desensitized and be okay with it as adults. Even as adults! Dogs at work who used to bite at me touching their feet now just look sad.

Having your pet used to being handled in these ways makes it so much easier, SAFER, and less stressful for the vet staff and your pet! Though they may not know us, and they hurt, we aren’t asking them to do anything they’re unfamiliar with. Restraint is as much for their safety as ours. Plus, if they’re even semi cooperative instead of out right fighting us, we’re more able to work with them (hold this way instead of that, give cookies/scratches to distract, less pressure in this spot) instead of unable to do anything without sedation (in terms of drawing blood, xrays, ultrasounds, etc).

ETA: in response to common comments -

1. Please don’t stick anything up your pet’s butt. 

2. I’m not talking about handling your pet (small, large, cat, dog, rat, bird, whatever) in a way that stresses them out more or harms them or you. This is not meant to say “I’m gonna touch your feet and you’ll deal with it or else.” I’m talking about training like anything else. Do whatever baby step for a moment or two, reward. Love. Repeat, go on with your day and try again in several hours or the next day. Don’t go straight to what stresses them out most. If they hate their feet being touched, start with petting their chest, then leg, then foot. Or whatever along those lines. 

3. If you’re not sure about your particular animal and their quirks and they really hate x or y, or have reasons from their past to not like being handled in x or y manner, talk to your vet. Talk to a trainer. 

4. If you have tried, and your pet (again, whatever species) is just hardcore no way in *hell* are you doing that with me, and you’ve worked with your vet and talked with a trainer or otherwise exhausted your options - it’s OKAY. Some animals just aren’t going to want to be handled in certain ways. That’s fine! Just know that if someone who doesn’t know your pet has to work with them, you’ll need to inform that person. 

5. If you don’t like how the vet or trainer is saying to do something, find a new one. You and your pet are unique individuals and what works for others may not work for you. Don’t be afraid to search for 2nd or even 3rd opinions to find what does work.

One possible way to check whether an item has a hidden camera facing towards you is to use your phone: To check whether your phone is capable of detecting it, open your camera app, point a TV remote towards it and press any button on the remote. If you can see a small light, which is normally invisible to the naked eye, you can start using your phone to scan the rooms for potential spy cams.

Turn off the lights in the room you want to sweep. Then turn on your smartphone’s camera and start looking for any glowing lights. 

Make sure to investigate items which seem out of place, like a phone charger still stuck in the wall. Popular places to hide a spycam are alarm clocks and fire detectors, for example.

The smartphone trick only works when the hidden cam is equipped with night vision.

LifeProTips,hvl9ic,LPT: The best way to respond to a bully Is to genuinely and openly question their motives and intentions.,"I wanted to make this post for young people in particular, but I feel it applies quite broadly.

I have Tourrettes Syndrome. This is a very misunderstood condition. When most people think Tourrettes, they think ""involuntarily cursing"". That is a even more niche sub condition called Coprolalia. It's quite rare. People also often assume that it's a cognitive impairment condition, which is also incorrect.

For me, it primarily manifests as involuntary muscle tics, such as shaking my head, or rolling my wrists, and less often as a verbal tic; clearing my throat or sniffing.

As an adult, I've rarely had negative interactions with people. The tics come and go in levels of severity, so some people don't even know I have it. If they ask, I explain. 

As a kid, I was not often given such an opportunity, nor did I posses the eloquence to articulate what I was going through.

I was bullied pretty ruthlessly.

Usually I responded to the bullying by getting upset or shutting down. Neither did more than add fuel to the fire. However, there was an incident when I was 15 that drastically changed how I addressed things.

I was waiting with some friends for the School Bus to take us home and some guy came up to me, got in my face and starting calling me names mocking me.

I'd never met him before. I didn't know his name. I was about to get upset, and then for some reason I didn't.  

Instead I calmly asked ""Why are doing this? I dont know you. Did I do something to you for you to treat me this way?""

He paused, and then he turned around a left.

Days later he came up to me in the hallway and asked if we could talk. 

He apologized and said that he doesn't know why he acted that way. He said that when I asked him why he was doing it, he realized he didn't have an answer and that he then he thought about how he would have felt in my position. 

I was shocked, but I accepted his apology and forgave him. We actually became good friends after that.

This interaction drastically changed how I approached bullying. Any time it happened, I would use this approach and 1 for 1 it would stop.

The person either apologized or just left me alone.

If any of you are going through anything similar, I would recommend trying this approach. Take a deep breathe, look them in the eyes and ask ""why?"".

It may not solve every situation, but it helped me and I hope it helps you too.

Edit: I wanted to respond to those who advocate violence as a solution.

Prior to the incident I described, I had gotten into many fights with bullies. I was not a small kid. By 15, i was 6'1 and more than capable of demolishing those who targeted me, and on several occasions I did.

Every time, I regretted it immensely. Violence is always an option, but it's a zero sum game. All it resulted in was fear of me and mocking from a distance.

When I used communication instead, the outcome was vastly different.

I'm not saying my solution is a perfect one, but I beleive that communication is the universal solvent. It should be the first option and the primary ""weapon"" in your arsenal against people. You'd be surprised how effective it is.",1595384506,"The best way to respond to a bully Is to genuinely and openly question their motives and intentions.

And for most of childhood that is essentially a service role - they do things for you, you take things from them.

I'm now in my 30s and I realized I only knew a few select moments in both of their lives before I existed. A couple of highlights, but nothing that really painted a picture about how they came to be the people they were as adults. 

So a couple of years ago I asked them both to write down their story for my birthday.

Howdy!

We did this for my 96 year old grandmother, since we haven't been able to visit her.  We had to come up with a solution that would work for her, even though she's not in a position to learn any technology at the moment.

I bought an inexpensive tablet with a cellular internet connection from Verizon, and set it up so that it would automatically accept video calls over Skype from me and the rest of my family (the Skype app has a setting for that). Then I sanitized it, and dropped it off for her.

When we call, we're immediately connected. My grandmother doesn't need to tap or touch anything to answer the call. She just needs to keep the tablet plugged into its charger in a place where she can hear our voices when we call.

There was also no need to set the tablet up on WiFi, since it uses a cellular connection. For her, it worked ""out of the box.""  The tablet's cellular connection only costs us $10/month extra on our existing phone family plan.

My grandmother has really enjoyed it. 🙂

If anyone here wants to set up a tablet like this for a friend or relative, I've written up [some detailed instructions](https://tabletconnect.org/) explaining how to do it.

From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought. 
 
Within a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period. 
 
The one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.

LifeProTips,dlgzew,"LPT: If you own a vehicle. Please, be extremely mindful of your tire air pressures.","I worked in the automotive industry for over 5 years. I have encountered too many people whom are unaware of how important proper tire air pressure is. The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) in your vehicle is an aid to this matter. It is only there to let you know about drastic differences in air pressure between your tires. We have to remember that the tires on our vehicles are what dictate how well we will be able to handle said vehicle. Tires are what make contact with the road, thus should be the forefront of our safety priorities. Rather not have to use your seatbelt because you were able to brake in time, then total your vehicle due to an over inflated tire.

Yes, i said that correctly, over inflated. When we over inflate our tires, we decrease the surface area that makes contact with the road. In turn, reducing friction between the tire and road. This increases our distance to come to a stop, and how much under/over steer we experience. Over inflated tires are also more suceptable to blow outs due to the already high pressure. Over inflated tires suffer decreased life time, dangerous cracking, and decreased traction.

Under inflated tires are just as dangerous. We are more attentive to a low pressure tire because they are more visible. Severely under inflated tires can unseat from the bead, causing you to possibly lose control of your vehicle. Pot holes and bumps on the road can possibly pinch the wall of a low pressure tire, causing you to lose said tire. Decreased gas mileage is also an effect of under inflated tires. When a tire is under inflated, it does not have enough pressure to keep proper shape, thus ""folding"" under the vehicle when moving. This increase how much torque must be applied for said tires to rotate. 

Most vehicles, on the drivers door jamb, have a tire pressure information sticker. If we follow those guidelines, we will all be safer on the roads. If you find your tires to be incorrectly inflated, once corrected, you will immediately feel the difference. Gas mileagedepends on how you drive but, your tires will always have an effect. Please, be safe on the roads. We already have to deal with enough to have to go through something that could of been avoided by properly inflated tires.

Or looking like an asshole because you went out of your way to put all this effort into something they don't show up for or make it obvious that they aren't having a good time. 

The people that want a big deal made out of their bday will make it known, trust me. If they aren't mentioning it until the day of or kind of hiding it, just saying ""happy birthday"" is probably more than enough for that person."

LifeProTips,btqqyk,LPT: Bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike,"**TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.** 

Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.  

The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail. 

She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.* 

I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing. 

And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad. 

The things I have in mine include: 

\- Survival heating blanket

\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- Whistle

\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- Critical meds and bandages

\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- Compass (if you're able to use it)

\- Paracord

Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.** 

Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.  

The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail. 

She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.* 

I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing. 

And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad. 

The things I have in mine include: 

\- Survival heating blanket

\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- Whistle

\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- Critical meds and bandages

\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- Compass (if you're able to use it)

\- Paracord

\- Knife

\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).

LifeProTips,bri5ej,LPT: working out every morning and staying hydrated throughout the day are some of the easiest (and cheapest) ways to noticeably improve your mood and give you more energy.,"Working out in the morning, just enough to make you out of breath for a while + about 10-20 mins to recover will make you feel way better than getting a full nights rest. I can lose those 1-2 hours of sleep when I wake up early and still feel like I had a satisfying night when I had a nice workout. It also helps a lot with motivation, your blood is pumping and you feel like getting stuff done. The first twenty minutes you feel like shit after your workout though, but I have a long commute so I have time to recover before work. 

When you are dehydrated you feel groggy and sleepy. You might end up succumbing to cravings or feel like you can’t do anything without taking a nap. This always hits me when I get home from work because I always forget to drink water when I’m at home but always have water at my desk at work. 

Bonus tips: 
     have a glass of water with your coffee, caffeine does very little to you if you are dehydrated.

     Stop reading reddit! Read a book or listen to an audio book. It helps get your mind thinking instead of just scrolling endlessly (kind of obvious but still)

LifeProTips,b4t2ef,LPT: HOW OFTEN YOU SHOULD WASH YOUR STUFF!,"SHEETS: Once a week

Asthma, Hay fever and Eczema can all be triggered by dust mites which thrive in dirty sheets, Wash at a high temperature to kill all unwanted pests. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Pillows: Every three to six months 

Studies have shown that the weight of a pillow will increase over time due to the accumulation of dust mites. Using the gentle cycle on your washing machine, wash two pillows together at the same time, Quickly followed by two rinse cycles followed by one drying cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jeans: Every four to five wears 

Everytime you wash your jeans they will shrink ever so slightly. It is therefore best to wear your denim jeans several times before your wash them but be sure to wash them inside out in cold water . Then simply let them drip dry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bras: Every three to four wears

You should never wear the same bra two days in a row, due to the fact that the elastic needs time to reshape. With a proper rotation of a few bras, allowing each one 24 hours to reshape, you should on have to wash them every three to four wears using a regular machine cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hair: Every other day

Washing your hair every day will strip it of its natural oils, so its best to wash every other day instead. If you do suffer from oily roots, you can use dry shampoo to soak up any unwanted grease. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Windows: Twice a year 

Cleaning your windows both inside and out with a squeegee always produces the best results.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mattress: Every six months 

Despite its size the mattress is one of the easiest things to clean in your home. Firstly vacuum the top of the mattress using an upholstery attachment. Then remove any stains by wiping down the surface with a damp cloth and a small amount of upholstery shampoo.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Oven: Every Six Months 

Some ovens will clean themselves but if yours doesn't, you can always clean it overnight when you're not using it. To start remove the racks and leave them to soak in warm water. Next spray the interior and door with oven cleaner and leave for a few hours. Then simply wipe clean.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Carpet: Once a Year

When regularly cleaned, carpets can improve the air quality of a room by trapping allergens and dust. A quick vacuum should be followed by a full steam clean to suck up all the dirt.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Purse / Wallet: Every week

Tests have shown that purses and wallets sometimes carry E.coli and other unwanted germs. Alcohol free baby wipes should be used on leather materials and traditional machine or hand washes for cotton.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Washer/Dryer: Every Month

Washers and dryers are known to harbour bacteria such as E.Coli and salmonella. Set the machine to its highest level and hottest temperature. Then add two cups of white vinegar and run through its cycle. Repeat this with half a cup of baking soda and then wipe clearn.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sink and drain: Every day

The kitchen sink has the second highest concentration of microorganisms in your home. So daily cleaning is highly recommended. To do this spray with disinfectant and wipe down with a damp cloth.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Toilet: Once a Week

Even though we use our toilets daily they can often be overlooked when cleaning time arrives. Use disinfectant spray and a cloth to clean the exterior, and a cleanser  on the interior. Let the cleanser sit for ten minutes before scrubbing with the toilet brush to ensure that all the germs are eradicated.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bath towels: Once a week

As long as you are correctly drying out your bath towels during the day you can wait a week before you wash them. Take care to use half the amount of detergent  when washing as too much soap will make them less fluffy. Also wash in warm water and skip the fabric softener.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Refrigerator: Once a week

If you want to ensure that all of your food is stored in a germ free environment care should be taken to keep your refrigerator clean. Usea mixtureof equal parts water and white vinegarto wipe the inside as well as the outside and leave the door open for a short time afterwards to let it dry out

I usually did it the other way around, taking the big ones first to make space for the small ones. Turns out the other way around is much better.
The big leafs are basically the main power source of the plant. Taking all of them weakings the plan and it will slow down the growth. 
Takingthe small ones will declutter the plant and make space for more small leafs.

LifeProTips,9gctz1,"LPT: When writing your resume, use the STAR method to describe what you did in previous positions: Situation, Task, Action, Result","This is generally used for answering interview questions but is just as effective on paper. Hiring managers and other resume readers don't have the time to make these kinds of inferences about your skills and experiences, so you need to show them exactly what you have to offer. Spell it out for them. 

Let's say you tutored some kids while in high school. Maybe your descriptive points look something like this:

* Tutored several Grade 10 students in math
* Explained mathematical concepts and assisted in test preparation

The main question you want to ask yourself after each point is, ""so what?"" Okay, you taught some kids math, how are those skills applicable for the position you're applying for?

So using STAR, let's break it down:

Situation: These kids need help learning math. 

Task: Teach them math.

Action: Okay, so how are you teaching them math? By explaining mathematical concepts and assisting in test preparation. 

Result: The goal is to improve their academic performance and understanding of the subject. When applicable, use numbers. A 25% improvement is more helpful than ""improvement"" with no quantifier.

Employers want to know about results, since they tend to be good indicators of ability. As such, I recommend formatting descriptive points as ""[Result] through means of [Action]"". 

So now we have:

* Improved Grade 10 students' academic performance by up to 25% by explaining mathematical concepts and assisting in test preparation

Tada! Isn't that so much better?",1537122211,"When writing your resume, use the STAR method to describe what you did in previous positions: Situation, Task, Action, Result This is generally used for answering interview questions but is just as effective on paper. Hiring managers and other resume readers don't have the time to make these kinds of inferences about your skills and experiences, so you need to show them exactly what you have to offer. Spell it out for them. 

Let's say you tutored some kids while in high school. Maybe your descriptive points look something like this:

* Tutored several Grade 10 students in math
* Explained mathematical concepts and assisted in test preparation

The main question you want to ask yourself after each point is, ""so what?"" Okay, you taught some kids math, how are those skills applicable for the position you're applying for?

So using STAR, let's break it down:

Situation: These kids need help learning math. 

Task: Teach them math.

Action: Okay, so how are you teaching them math? By explaining mathematical concepts and assisting in test preparation. 

Result: The goal is to improve their academic performance and understanding of the subject. When applicable, use numbers. A 25% improvement is more helpful than ""improvement"" with no quantifier.

Employers want to know about results, since they tend to be good indicators of ability. As such, I recommend formatting descriptive points as ""[Result] through means of [Action]"". 

So now we have:

* Improved Grade 10 students' academic performance by up to 25% by explaining mathematical concepts and assisting in test preparation

Tada! Isn't that so much better?"

LifeProTips,99oz0h,LPT: Interviews are effortless if you view them as nothing more than a conversation,"The most important thing to realize when interviewing for anything, a job, school, or whatever, is that the interview in its most raw form is nothing more than a conversation between two humans. 

In the workforce this person may be superior to you, but outside of work you could have a conversation at a coffee shop and have no idea.  Realizing this helps me stay collected and calm in interviews.

Go into each interview with two things, the best clothes you have, and knowledge about the company. Remember it’s better to be overdressed than under dressed and nice clothes give confidence. Google the shit out of the company, the general job title, and what you’ll be doing exactly. Get an idea of the same position at other companies so you can be like “yeah i was looking at the same position at company X and i really like the way you guys do _____”. There’s no excuse for you to not be able to answer any question about what the position consists of, what the company stands out for, and what they look for in an employee. 

Stress things mentioned in the job posting, if they’re asking for someone organized, say you’re organized, even if you’re not super organized. 

The most important thing to do though is stay calm, going in with fake confidence, makes you look confident, and makes the other person think you’re confident, even if you’re not. Fake it till you make it. Never stress an interview like it’s the most important thing in the world, because it’s not. It’s just one person and if you make an ass out of yourself then whatever, the next person doesn’t know that, and now you know how not to make an ass out of yourself. 


My first job I was promoted to assistant manager so I was given interviewing experience at a very young age. So I would sit there, clearly seeing that people are nervous as shit about this interview at a gym and I realized “why are these people nervous, I’m just a college student who works too much, I’m not scary” and I realized there is a person on both sides of that interview, just treat it like a conversation. 

Following that job at the gym I received an interview at a bank, and this was the worst experience of my life. I guess I wasn’t completely prepared for the interview, but the manager of the bank was also upset that he had to come in on his day off, in jeans and a t shirt to interview me. So he pretty much sat me down, told me that my resume was trash (even though I was a college student working in management) and told me everything else that was wrong with me, which ended with me standing up, saying never mind I’m not interested and leaving. Starting myself so young with those two experiences back to back helped me understand the process a little better and be more comfortable with it. ",1535042583,"Interviews are effortless if you view them as nothing more than a conversation The most important thing to realize when interviewing for anything, a job, school, or whatever, is that the interview in its most raw form is nothing more than a conversation between two humans. 

In the workforce this person may be superior to you, but outside of work you could have a conversation at a coffee shop and have no idea.  Realizing this helps me stay collected and calm in interviews.

Go into each interview with two things, the best clothes you have, and knowledge about the company. Remember it’s better to be overdressed than under dressed and nice clothes give confidence. Google the shit out of the company, the general job title, and what you’ll be doing exactly. Get an idea of the same position at other companies so you can be like “yeah i was looking at the same position at company X and i really like the way you guys do _____”. There’s no excuse for you to not be able to answer any question about what the position consists of, what the company stands out for, and what they look for in an employee. 

Stress things mentioned in the job posting, if they’re asking for someone organized, say you’re organized, even if you’re not super organized. 

The most important thing to do though is stay calm, going in with fake confidence, makes you look confident, and makes the other person think you’re confident, even if you’re not. Fake it till you make it. Never stress an interview like it’s the most important thing in the world, because it’s not. It’s just one person and if you make an ass out of yourself then whatever, the next person doesn’t know that, and now you know how not to make an ass out of yourself.

LifeProTips,904kzt,"LPT: at least every few month, do a review of your life and think about the actions you should take to better it by asking yourself a few questions.","This is a system that I’ve been using for a few years now (thanks CGP grey) but only recently has been codified such that it could provide a useful LPT (thanks Triggers by Marshal Goldsmith, I highly recommend it). Here are the questions in order:

* Are you happy?
  * What makes you happy?
     * Of those things, what can you improve?
         * What specific actions do you have to take to improve them?
      * Of the things you can't improve, what do you have to do to preserve them?
  * What makes you unhappy?
      * Of those things, what can you eliminate/lessen?
          * What specific actions do you have to take to eliminate them?
      * Of the things you can't eliminate, what do you have to accept?
          * Why?

**Specific** is very important here because, [quoting grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o), goals should be *Specific*, *Measurable*, *Actionable*, for which you are *Responsible* and *Time-bounded*, not *Vague*, *Amorphous*, *Pie-in-the-sky*, *Irrelevant*, *Delayed*. (3:28)

Now that you know what you should do, comes de hardest part: doing it. An advice I can give for that is... [just do it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)

Seriously, because in my experience, the more you ""just do it"", the easier it gets. Other advice include asking yourself daily questions in the form of ""did I do my best to try and achieve X"". Reminding yourself that it's normal to not succeed on the first try and that the most important part is not ""never failing"" but ""always trying again"" (example, the estimated number of quit attempts it takes to quit smoking successfully is [**lowballed** at 7](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e011045)).

And even if you don't act on those actions, just being mindful of the specific things you should do helps, because it should unconsciously push you in the right direction as your brain ruminates about them in the background.

Introspection is the first step towards a happy life.

# Example:

Me 3.5 years ago, after six months of high school:

* **Are you happy?** No.
  * **What makes you happy?** Going to school, doing sport, spending time with friends and family, watching youtube and anime, playing video game.
     * **Of those things, what can you improve?** spending time with friends, doing sport.
         * **What specific actions do you have to take to improve them?** Not eating alone even if I want to in the moment, knocking to see if somebody's inside a room even if I'm shitting my pants stressing about their reaction. We have a gym, go there more often.
      * **Of the things you can't improve, what do you have to do to preserve them?** The rest is going well, I can just continue doing what I'm already doing.
  * **What makes you unhappy?** Needing one hour to fall asleep/sleeping eight hours and so missing a lot of the evening time. Feeling lonely.
      * **Of those things, what can you eliminate/lessen?** Feeling lonely.
          * **What specific actions do you have to take to eliminate them?** Already adressed.
      * **Of the things you can't eliminate, what do you have to accept?** My sleep.
          * **Why?** It's biological, can't really do anything to change that and my sleep hygiene's already pretty maxed out.

It took two years for me to learn how to be social and not stress to death each time I send a message to somebody, it was hard but it was worth it and it's the thing I'm the most proud about. Remember you are not static, you can change and you can force that change (to a degree).

Edit 2: the side by side’s we’d sell were 450 lbs of long, tall, and wide machine. One of the doors would have a built-in ice maker and electronics inside it. That door was easily 50 lbs if not more by itself. Then, you still have the other side door and the bottom freezer door. Removing the doors made it close to 100 lbs lighter. No, even with a standard dolly, I can’t move 450 lbs up and down stairs without damaging property. Plus, you can keep the doors from being damaged by moving them separately. 

Edit 3: I don’t know if this voids the warranty. I just installed and repaired the appliances. However, we’d do this to almost every new fridge we’d deliver. There was never a problem with the manufacturer and I don’t even know how they’d know it was done. I mean it’s just screws for the doors and hinges and clips for the waterline and electronic line. There wasn’t any tape or any type of system to show that the doors had been tampered with. 

Edit 4: if your fridge has water and electronic lines running through the door, unclip the lines 1st before unscrewing that door.

Edit 2: the side by side’s we’d sell were 450 lbs of long, tall, and wide machine. One of the doors would have a built-in ice maker and electronics inside it. That door was easily 50 lbs if not more by itself. Then, you still have the other side door and the bottom freezer door. Removing the doors made it close to 100 lbs lighter. No, even with a standard dolly, I can’t move 450 lbs up and down stairs without damaging property. Plus, you can keep the doors from being damaged by moving them separately. 

Edit 3: I don’t know if this voids the warranty. I just installed and repaired the appliances. However, we’d do this to almost every new fridge we’d deliver. There was never a problem with the manufacturer and I don’t even know how they’d know it was done. I mean it’s just screws for the doors and hinges and clips for the waterline and electronic line. There wasn’t any tape or any type of system to show that the doors had been tampered with. 

Edit 4: if your fridge has water and electronic lines running through the door, unclip the lines 1st before unscrewing that door. 

Edit 5: all contractors out there. Can you not install those super tiny really high hard to reach cabinets over the fridge space. No one really uses them and the fridges are only getting taller. We would either have to rip them out or have the client buy a smaller model. "

Luckily for us our phones were in our jacket pockets when it happened (second LPT? Don’t keep your phones loose in your vehicle) so when we came to on the side of the highway we were able to call 911. Our car was mangled and we couldn’t get the doors open so we were stuck inside but I could see through my side window as vehicle after vehicle after vehicle passed by us. Seriously there were over like 40 vehicles that passed by us. 
After getting out of the hospital we were speaking with the police recently and something they said really struck me. The only 911 call placed at all was from us. Not a single person stopped, which I can somewhat understand when it’s dark and icy out, but of all of those vehicles nobody even called 911. 
If we had been knocked unconscious longer, or if our phones had been wrecked in the crash, we would have been stuck there for who knows how long. My kid probably would have died (he needed emergency surgery), we could have ended up freezing or bleeding out. It was really.... actually quite depressing when I heard that the only people who called it in were us! 
So the next time you see an accident when driving just play it safe and call it in. You could save a life.

Edit: to clarify I want to state that yes I would much prefer for everyone to go and help if they witness an accident or emergency as well as call 911. That would 100% be preferable. I was just trying to reach the absolute laziest, scared, ambivalent, etc. out there and say if you DON’T stop you should at least call 911. 
If your countries laws require you to stop at an emergency and help then yes obviously do that.

Edit Again: it’s been brought up that if it’s just a minor thing like a fender bender that calling 911 can be a waste of time and resources. I agree that this can occur and obviously you have to use your judgement (stop and assess if you can as that will help with this) but I still stand by my post that if you don’t know it’s better to err on the side of caution and call.

Even if you think someone definitely must have called 911 already, call 911 anyway.

Luckily for us our phones were in our jacket pockets when it happened (second ? Don’t keep your phones loose in your vehicle) so when we came to on the side of the highway we were able to call 911. Our car was mangled and we couldn’t get the doors open so we were stuck inside but I could see through my side window as vehicle after vehicle after vehicle passed by us. Seriously there were over like 40 vehicles that passed by us. 
After getting out of the hospital we were speaking with the police recently and something they said really struck me. The only 911 call placed at all was from us. Not a single person stopped, which I can somewhat understand when it’s dark and icy out, but of all of those vehicles nobody even called 911.

Do you want a huge baller rock that’s a moissanite or a small conservative diamond.  She wanted the bling.  I have a good job so everyone assumes it’s real, and it looks amazing.  Spent about $2200 on it for a 2 carat center stone, in a halo, on a white gold band.  They are even cheaper now.

Do some research, as there a few lines of high quality colorless moissanite that are much nicer than the super cheap ones.

You may be ""grandfathered in"" on a slower, more expensive plan.","Realized this the other day, and I wish I had figured it out years ago. My family has been on the same internet + phone + cable package from Knology (now WOW) for over a decade. After fees and taxes, my dad was paying $270/mo for the whole package, and though I don't know the cable/phone details, I do know we were only getting 20 Mbps down/2 Mbps up internet speed. That didn't seem right to me, so I went and took alook.

On their website, this ISP does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. They do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).

Turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. So while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.

One call to the ISP, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. We are now getting 1Gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 Mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.

Edit: For like the 50th time, I typed down when I meant to type up, and up when I meant to type down. My speed is 1G down, 50M up, not the other way around.

Also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every ISP** and in fact some ISPs will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers.

LifeProTips,7jxtam,"LPT: if you get mail delivered that’s already been opened, report it to the postal inspector","There’s lots of holiday cards being sent through the mail this time of year. They are easy to spot since they’re usually a very distinct shape and size. Many times these cards will have checks or cash in them, making them really easy targets for mail theft. 

It’s clearly easy to track who cashed a stolen check, but not so much with cash. 

If your mail is arriving opened and things are missing, report it. There is a special postal inspection service specifically for this type of thing. You can report online or over the phone. 

[Here is the link to their site. ](https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/)  I called them today to report this exact issue and was routed to a real, live person very quickly AND they were courteous and very helpful. Took all pertinent information and confirmed it and let me know I would be contacted in the next 2-3 business days.  It was all very efficient and easy. 

Suggest to family members and people that might send cash in a card to, instead, send a check (since they’re easier to track, can do stop payments if necessary). If they must send cash, have them send in a standard sized security envelope (the kind that have some type of pattern on the inside to make them less transparent), or in a standard sized not security envelope, but wrapped in a piece of lined paper or two so it isn’t readily apparent what’s inside. 


**edit:** wow, this got popular! 
 
* Because there may be some confusion, reporting to your post office, is not the same as reporting to the postal inspector.

* I posted this because I have recently had my mail arrive deliberately opened.  And I mean, the envelope was sealed with packing tape that had been sliced through, presumably with a knife-like object.  

* I am in the US, but from the comments, it looks like the UK has something similar for their mail.  A quick Google search looked to have some good resources.

* There's a lot of folks saying nothing will happen, and that may be the case, but from reading the web site, it looks like they determine whether to investigate based on trends and number of reports.  If several people in a neighborhood are being affected, maybe try getting everyone to call in and report the issue so the inspectors don't write it off to ""the mail machine probably tore up the envelope.""

* If you can tell me how to get rid of the picture, I would be happy to.  When I added the link to the inspector's site, I guess Reddit decided to pick a picture of one of their most wanted.

LifeProTips,7b7b4v,"LPT: if you live alone, put together a ""sick kit"" for those times you get sick and don't want to/can't go to the store","I thought about this today because I woke up early this morning with a touch of either a stomach bug or mild food poisoning. I live alone, my family lives out-of-state, and being that I'm in my 30s, all of my friends have jobs during the week and I'm not going to call and bother any of them at 6am to go get stuff for me at the grocery store. So I ended up mustering as much strength as I could and going to Kroger to get stuff like ginger ale, pedialyte, chicken soup, saltines, and popsicles. It was not one of my best moments.

I couldn't help think how it would have been so much more convenient if I had some sort of pre-prepared ""sick kit"" containing these types of items. I was always taught to keep medicines around in my first aid kit like Tylenol, pepto bismol, Vicks vapo rub, cough drops etc. - general medicines you need for when you're sick but not ""go to the doctor"" sick. However, this kind of stuff is really only half of what I needed today. I needed liquids to drink that would be easy on my stomach (and replenish what I was losing through... things that happen in the bathroom when you're sick) and bland foods to keep up my strength without making me sicker.  I didn't really have anything on hand, because these aren't items I consume regularly. I just don't get sick very often.

It would have been nice to be able to just get out my kit and have everything I went to the store for today, since these are pretty common types of items that I like to have whenever I have any sort of general cold/flu/bug. You can make your own list of preferred items, but here's what I'm going to stock for future use:

Saltine crackers
Pedialyte/Gatorade
Plain rice cereal (chex, Rice Krispies, etc.)
Flavor-ice style popsicles that can be stored at room temp and popped into the freezer when needed
Ginger ale
Chicken noodle soup
Applesauce

Even if you don't live alone, a kit like this could come in handy. I know that there are delivery services that exist now too, but you will pay a premium for the products and you still have to wait for delivery. Pre-stocking a kit allows you to be picky about what you will pay, and not everyone lives where delivery is available anyway.

One last note, obviously most of this stuff is perishable, so keep your kit somewhere that you won't forget about it until it's too late.
 
EDIT - wow guys, this has been fun! I posted this and passed out for a while and woke up to a ton of fun comments and other great suggestions. A couple of quick notes...

1) Yes, as many people have pointed out (and as I did too) there are grocery delivery services that exist like Amazon prime now. I think this is still a good tip for many reasons. First of all, like I already said, you will pay premium prices for products through most delivery services, and many of them have minimum purchase limits and/or delivery fees. And then there's the fact that you have to wait for the delivery. Also there are ""business hours"" for most of these services, so if you wake up puking in the middle of the night, you'll have to wait until they're open. Lastly many people still don't live where these services are available.

2) The main criticism I'm hearing is something along the lines of, ""Don't you already keep stuff like this around the house? I mean obviously any responsible adult would stock these items."" Well, here's the thing, not everyone thinks to stock foods they almost never eat/drink. Congratulations if you regularly buy pedialyte and canned chicken noodle soup, but a lot of people wouldn't think to buy these items normally. So if this is what you're thinking of commenting, trust me it's already been said.",1509995034,"if you live alone, put together a ""sick kit"" for those times you get sick and don't want to/can't go to the store I thought about this today because I woke up early this morning with a touch of either a stomach bug or mild food poisoning.

A lot of people have brought up the mess factor, in my experience my dog finishes this well before it melts, if your dog is picky or loses interest in challenging tasks quickly this might not be for them or might need to be an outside only treat.

Also, definitely check your chicken broth for onions, many of you have mentioned that they are bad for doggo. My vet recommended this to me and did not mention this as a concern but I will definitely be taking this into consideration.

LifeProTips,6n22eg,"LPT: If you buy a new car, and the dealership calls and says there's an issue with the contract and you need to come back and re-sign, do not do it until you have them send you the new contract and mark all the changes.","Someone mentioned car dealerships doing this in another thread, and I didn't even think about it when it happened to me. I went home and looked at the original contract and the contract they had me re-sign and noticed several differences that I didn't notice before because my payment was the same and, due to our friendly conversation, I was admittedly distracted, trusted him, and didn't read the new contract because my payment was exactly the same. 

What the dealership had done was originally financed my car through the dealership for a lower interest rate, then changed a lot of the finance numbers to ensure that everything matched for me in the short term (i.e. my monthly payment) but my interest rate jumped three percent, I assume the commission for the salesman had jumped, and they sold my contract to another finance company. The numbers inside the contract including the final sale price of the car, the trade in of my car, additional warranty for mechanical issues, the gap coverage, and other miscellaneous dealership fees had changed dramatically to suit the needs of the finance contract to ensure that they could get the financing. I'm now getting the paperwork from the finance company to ensure that what the dealership sent them matches what they gave me.

TL:DR - Don't sign anything without reading everything first, and get all changes in writing which highlights all changes before signing a new contract from any dealership.

Edited to remove an assumption on commission.

Edit 2 for clarification - The dealership informed me during the first signing that I was approved through one finance company and had me sign the contract, and idiotically (my fault admittedly, while letting the guy talk to me through the signing and not paying attention to what I was reading,) what I was actually signing was financing through the dealership.

LifeProTips,6ihcog,LPT- Dont buy a new car ever. As a former CPF the biggest waste of money young people make are buying cars new.,"I used to work for UBS as a CFP before i went to pharmacy school and i used to handle a lot of younger accounts between the ages of 25-35. 

Never ever buy a car new. Its the single worst money mistake anyone can make. 

The reasons are that new cars have a huge depreciation upon purchase. 90% of the time a car is purchased brand new you are already upside down since its a depreciating asset. I cant tell you how many kids i have seen that make 50k a year and are drowning due to a $500 a month car payment, thats about 32k financed at 72 months. 

Cars only take you from point A-B. There is literally no point financially in buying a fancy new BMW or Mercedes.  I always recommend buying something under 20k that is a CPO.  You can find amazing deals on 1-2 year old cars with full warranty in that price range. 

The only issues with buying used is that you will pay a slightly higher interest rate but that will not be an issue.  Another note is even if they offer you a 0% interest rate its still usually a bad deal. For example a new chevrolet malibu is around 30k new. it was being offered at a 0% interest rate for 60 months. currently you can buy a 2014 malibu for around 11k if you where to take the payments on that malibu even at 0% you would still be upside down on the car and owe more than its worth in only 3 years. 

Here is some math to explain my point. You can buy a 3 year old Malibu every 3 years for 9 years and still be way better of financially. The reason is that when you go to sell the malibu in 3 years time you may get 7-8k for it when you go and sell the new malibu it would only be worth 11k in 3 years. You can see how the money adds up drastically in 9 years time of buying and selling new versus used. your total used cost would be less than what you would lose when selling a new Malibu 1 time.  


























Here are the reasons why this is.

When buying a car used you also dont take as much as a depreciation hit when reselling a car.  For instance when buying a car for $10k the depreciation on the car is almost terminal and it will maybe lose 5-10% of its value per year compared to a new car that can take a 20-30% depreciation per year. For a 40k car that can be a huge hit financially. The cheaper the car the less deprecation will effect it per year. 

Hopefully this can paint a picture for anyone looking to buy a car in the future. This should be common knowledge but many people dont look at things with the future in mind. 














Edit 
people are misinterpreting my post. This is purely from a financial standpoint. From a finance perspective buying new is a terrible investment. I am only looking at it from a financial side were you can use the funds saved and apply them to a 401k, RothIRA or house all of those can be considered appreciating assets. Of course there are exemption and not everyone is in the same boat financially. Buying new can sometimes make sense from a business perspective for tax reasons or high use as well as buying new under 15k.

LifeProTips,6fdljr,"LPT: 15 years Repairing Electronics Here: With Liquid Damaged Electronics, DON'T Use Rice, Instead Use A Fan (explanation inside)","I've spent nearly 20 years repairing liquid/water damaged electronics. More specifically, cell phones. In the old days, we'd open the phones up, clean the corrosion, resolder, etc. Recently, they've (the manufacturers) moved away from local repairs and moved more towards warranty replacements, swap outs (FRU = factory replacement units) &amp; insurance. Now if you want your electronics repaired locally, you have to visit 3rd party independent people since you can no longer have it done in a corporate-ran store.

I know rice is the go-to recommendation for water damaged phones and other electronics, and it works, to an extent. It will **passively** absorb moisture. Unfortunately, you don't want to passively absorb the moisture, you want to *actively* **remove** the moisture as quickly as possible.  The longer the moisture is sitting on those circuit boards, the higher the risk of corrosion. And corrosion on electrical components can happen within just a few short hours. If the damage isn't severe, we'd take contact cleaner (essentially 92% or better rubbing alcohol, the higher the percentage, the quicker it will evaporate) and scrub the white or green powder (the corrosion that formed) with a toothbrush to remove it. If that corrosion crosses contacts, it can cause the electronics to act up, fail or short out. The liquid itself almost never is directly responsible for failed consumer electronics, it's the corrosion that takes place after the fact (or the liquid damaging the battery, a new battery fixes this issue obviously). 

Every time I see someone recommend rice I kinda twinge a little inside because while it does dry a phone out slightly better than just sitting on a counter, it really doesn't do much to prevent the corrosion that's going to be taking place due to the length of time the liquid has had to fester inside the phone or whatever. 

What you want to do is set the item in front of a fan with constant airflow. Take the device apart as much as you can without ruining it (remove the battery, etc) so that the insides can get as much airflow as possible. Even if it's not in direct contact with the air, the steady air blowing over the device will create a mini vacuum effect and pull air from inside. It's just a small amount but it's significantly better than just allowing the rice to passively absorb the evaporated moisture. True, rice can act as a desiccant, but a fan blowing over whatever is orders of magnitude faster. 

I personally will take apart a piece of electronics completely, and put those items in front of a fan, and if you have the relevant knowledge, I highly recommend doing so as well. But if you don't, it's not that big of an issue. What you want to avoid at all costs, however, is **heat**. Do not put your phone inside an oven or hot blow dryer, heat can damage electronics just as bad as liquid, sometimes more so. Heat, extreme cold and liquid are bad for electronics &amp; cell phones. A fan (lots of airflow) is 99 out of 100 times better at removing moisture quickly than rice. I would say 100 out of 100 but I'm sure there's going to be some crazy situation or exception I haven't thought of that someone will come in and point out. I'd like to remind people that exceptions are just that, they don't invalidate the rule.

LifeProTips,6dqbi3,"LPT: Call your electric company each month around the time they read your meter, and submit your own meter reading.","Many people aren't aware of this, but most electric companies have a feature when you call to enter your meter reading yourself.  My wife and I had noticed that during the months of December, January, and February (we have gas heat and live in Indiana where it gets pretty cold during the winter months, so we did NOT run our AC during those months,) our bill was much higher than what we had anticipated.  So, during the month of March, we decided to keep track of our meter for a full 30 days.  During that time, we only used about half the amount of electricity that our electric company claimed we had used during the preceding three months.  

That was when we learned we could enter our own meter reading by calling the customer service number of our electric company (Duke Energy for us,) and that, apparently, sometimes electric companies don't actually read your meters, they just estimate your bill based on previous months usage.  At the end of March, April, and now May, we have been entering our own meter reading, and have proceeded to see a drop of nearly 33% to our electric bill compared to the months we had not entered our reading.  It makes it even more surprising that during the months we've been entering our own reading, we have been using our air more and more and have still continued to see a lower bill.  So, if you feel like your bill is higher than it should be, perhaps consider checking your own meter reading and comparing it to what your electric bill says. If you notice any discrepancies or feel like something is off, check with your electric company and see if they offer the ability to enter your own reading manually.  

Tl;Dr: If your electric bill seems higher than it should be, consider submitting your usage from your meter to your electric company manually. 

Edit: I see a lot of people defending the person who does the actual readings in this situation.  Please let me make myself clear that I am not at all blaming the man or woman who comes out and reads your meter. I am fully aware that they are just people trying to do their jobs and there are plenty of mitigating circumstances that may prevent them from being able to get a true reading.  Entering your reading yourself only takes about two minutes, and just helps to avoid situations where you get a bill that is significantly higher one month than you expected it to be.  Again, I am not in any way trying to say that the person doing the reading is at fault, I don't think that at all and just felt like I should clarify that.  I am also not saying that your bill won't even out over time.

LifeProTips,6dhr6z,"LPT: Caring what other people think about you is just part of being young. The sooner you can learn to let go of your attachment to other people's validation, the sooner you begin to live your real life before retirement.","As a shy individual who spends a lot of my time beating myself up, the number one thing I hear from people in their 50's if I tell them this about myself is this: ""you remind me of a younger me"". 

Point being, caring what others think is just sort of programmed into the minds of the average young person. But nobody really cares what others think about them by the time they reach their 50's. They just don't. They've lived enough life to see that it literally serves NO point. But they're the same person. We are so attached to it that we feel like validation from our peers is literally essential to survival. But it is not, in any way, whatsoever. So many of the older people I talk to just say they feel the exact same as they did when they were in their prime, just now they are in a 50+ year old body.

So, for the love of God, stop caring what others think of you, find something you love, put the horse blinders on, and just do the shit out of what makes you happy. There is absolutely no reason, whatsoever, that you need to care about how other people are perceiving you. It is only causing you unnecessary stress, at which nothing can be gained, even if you think you're doing everything right to keep others happy. Losing battle.

Maybe your life has become so unconsciously centered around winning other people's validation, that you don't even know what I'm talking about. You have a following, and that keeps you going. But you don't really know yourself that well. You're going to be addicted to tangible, destructive things when you get older: gambling, smoking, drinking, etc. because you can't get anybody to care about what you're doing anymore. Because you're old now, and nobody really cares about what you're doing or who you are, minus maybe your immediate family, if you have any (I know that was a harsh sentence but the right people will know what I'm trying to get at). You're one of the type of person that seriously needs help before it's too late. What you may think is socialization and healthy conversation with others about your life, achievements, and why you're definitely going to heaven is just your brain subconsciously trying to get a fix of self-validation off the person: ""I'm going to make sure this person knows how amazing I am and then breathe a sigh of relief "" like you just stuck a needle in your vein.

Point in summary: Just about everyone who gets past the age of 50 stops caring what others think about them because they finally see that it serves absolutely no purpose. So, if you're young, take their advice. Get the ball rolling early. It's easier said than done, but with a bit of courage, you can make your path by walking. We're all made of the same thing. So trying to keep everybody happy and constantly gaining reassurance that you're okay and everybody likes you is an addictive activity that serves zero purpose. The sooner you can legitimately stop caring what others think about you and just listen to yourself and trust yourself and your true endeavors, the sooner you have eliminated a toxic addiction from your body that will have bad long-term effects.

I should have specified that this post was meant to be directed to the people out there also like me who have done so much caring about what people think that we're sick and tired of beating ourselves up and having a gratuitous, illogical and harmful amount of self-doubt. I didn't say it was easy, but through some epiphanies, I have experienced true freedom from my form of this mental prison before, and from what it felt like, it's worth it to work towards feeling this way as much as possible as early as you can in life.

LifeProTips,6989f0,"LPT, paying for an home alarm monitoring service is a waste of money","Ive been investigating residential burglaries for over 10 years. Myself and every other cop I know does NOT pay for a burglar alarm monitoring service. Why you ask? Because most burglars are in and out in under 5 minutes. The alarm company has to call the house, then after they dont get an answer, they call the police. Then the dispatch center has to get the details, set up the call, and dispatch an officer. The quickest I have ever seen this process is about 8-10 minutes from the door being breached to an officer on scene. 

If you want to make your house more secure, you can do a few things that burglars notice. a very large dog bowl at the front and back doors gets noticed, even if you dont have a dog. Also burglars avoid detection at all costs. Very obvious camera placement is a very good deterrent. Also wifi doorbells that have two way communication work well. There are many more, but alarm monitoring is a waste of money. 

Edit*** Since people have asked me what is a good set up for home security without paying a monthly fee....I am a big fan of smart home technology....I specifically go with smartthings. I can trigger lights based on motion sensors, I have wifi enabled cameras that I can access on my smartphone that can trigger lights and alert my phone. I still have an alarm system in my home, I just dont pay to have it monitored. Everything I listed does not have a monthly fee. Basically I am the monitoring service for my home, and im much quicker than a dispatcher calling another dispatcher.

LifeProTips,690rvb,"LPT: If you have an elderly loved one, encourage your family to walk with them daily.","I work in guardianship, and it is often my job to step in and see that elderly people have their needs taken care of when they no longer have family who are able or willing to take care of them. One thing that I see constantly in my line of work is elderly people sitting down in a wheelchair and never getting back up. Sometimes this happens for reasons out of our control, like the person is a fall risk or has fallen and broken something and needs to recover and doesn't get the proper Physical Therapy that they need. Other times it is more avoidable; the elderly person simply has no one to accompany them on a walk, spends all day sitting in their chair, and eventually loses the strength to be able to walk by themselves. 

Watching someone go from walking to being in a wheelchair all of the time usually results in one thing: their overall health rapidly diminishes. For example I have one gentleman who refused physical therapy and refused to walk after an injury. This gentleman went from being a spry 50 year old to looking like he was 80 years old in a matter of six months. It is also not uncommon to see people sit down in a wheelchair for good, and ultimately go to hospice within a year. 

If you have somebody that you love that is aging, encourage them to walk if they can, take them places even if it's a burden, walk with them, hire a companion to walk with them, encourage your family to help them stay active. In my experience there is one thing that people who make it into their seventies and eighties and beyond have in common, and that is that they keep moving.

Edit: Thanks for the gold!  Elder affairs are something I'm really passionate about, so if anyone else wants to give, find your local Public Guardianship office and make a donation!  These offices are state funded and often rely on grants, and they work to assure that people that are unable to make decisions for themselves, mostly elderly people, are well taken care of and get the services they need. 

If that's too much work, there's always [Meals on Wheels](https://www.mowaa.org/donate), who do an extremely incredible service for elderly people all over the US!

Edit 2:  Just wanted to point out, because I'm seeing a lot of this:  Elderly people can be a fall risk, and a fall could dramatically alter their health at an older age.  Don't take people who cannot walk well out for a walk.  Some time on a recumbent bike on the lowest setting, heck, even sitting in the chair and raising and lowering their legs could help immensely as a start.  **If you have a loved one who needs help getting back on their feet, look for physical therapists to work with them, don't try to do it yourself if you are untrained.**
