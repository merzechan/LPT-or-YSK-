YouShouldKnow,o31tvz,YSK SiriusXM is likely selling your info to those extended car warranty spammers,"**Why YSK:** SiriusXM is *likely* selling their customer data to those extended car warranty call lists. Here's how I know this.

Many years ago I purchased a used OEM radio that was originally installed in a 2008 Chrysler Aspen that had SiriusXM compatibility. The radio was compatible with my car though, like many Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep cars of the time, which was *not* a Chrysler Aspen. This was a cash sale, so the person who sold it to me knew nothing about me.

Since my last radio did not have satellite radio, I wanted to give it a try, so I subscribed. When you call or go online and enter the radio ID, it will confirm with you the year, make, and model that they have in their database for that radio ID. It matched what the seller said it came out of. Subscribed, activated, and everything worked fine.

To this day, I continue to get calls about purchasing an extended warranty for my, you guessed it, 2008 Chrysler Aspen. 

How could that be? I never actually owned one, nor have I owned anything even remotely close to that. The only person or company that ever knew I had any connection to one was SiriusXM. So that's how I know they sold/shared my data.


Edit: I would like to clarify, I am not saying they are the only ones. I get a lot of these calls. Some will specify a make and model of what they think I own, and some do not. It’s very clear that the ones that do sourced their data from SiriusXM, as they are the only ones that could link me to a 2008 Chrysler Aspen in any way.",1624055106,"SiriusXM is likely selling your info to those extended car warranty spammers **Why :** SiriusXM is *likely* selling their customer data to those extended car warranty call lists.

YouShouldKnow,o21u6r,"YSK: ""Medium"" and ""Hard"" toothbrushes are considered harmful by the ADA and almost no one should use them","If you go to a pharmacy toothbrush aisle you'll probably be provided with dozens of different shapes and sizes of brush, each with its own purported benefits. One of the many variations between different brushes you will sometimes see is bristle stiffness, which is generally Soft, Medium, or Hard/Firm. 

This choice is presented to consumers as a seemingly benign difference based on preference, like choosing between crisscross bristles or an angled tip, but it is very much not. There is a clear consensus to exclusively use [soft bristled brushes](https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/toothbrushes) for teeth, and no dentist will recommend that you use a medium or harder toothbrush since they can cause erosion and gum damage. 

Harder bristled toothbrushes do have some very limited special-case uses, such as cleaning dentures, but manufacturers continue to resist making that distinction clear in packaging and marketing. This leads to confusing double talk where Colgate [confirms on their website](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/selecting-dental-products/soft-vs-hard-toothbrush) that consumers should exclusively choose soft toothbrushes, but also markets medium firmness toothbrushes as [a standard product](https://www.colgate.com/en-gb/products/toothbrush/colgate-extra-clean-3-pack-toothbrush) even labeling them as ""Extra Clean,"" implying that they work better.

The industry is stuck in kind of a chicken-and-egg scenario that can cause you real harm. Some consumers want ""firmer"" toothbrushes based on lack of knowledge and no manufacturer wants to lose that market segment so they keep making them, but the ongoing availability of normal medium/firm brushes reinforces the misconception that they are standard choices that work better for some consumers. 

Why YSK: Whatever other choices you are making with picking brushes you should *never* choose a firmer bristle than soft without specific advice from your dentist, or you could damage your teeth or gums.

YouShouldKnow,o1m2t5,YSK if you are a server/ bartender it’s completely illegal to be forced by an employer to pay for a walked tab.,"
Why YSK: I’ve had it happen to me, I’ve seen it happen countless times. But it’s straight up illegal. Simple as that. In no case is it okay for a manager or owner to make you pay for someone else’s food because they decided to walk out on you without paying. 

According to the US Department of Labor;

*Where deductions for walk-outs, breakage, or cash register shortages reduce the employee’s wages below the minimum wage, such deductions are illegal. Where a tipped employee is paid $2.13 per hour in direct (or cash) wages and the employer claims the maximum tip credit of $5.12 per hour, no such deductions can be made without reducing the employee below the minimum wage (even where the employee receives more than $5.12 per hour in tips).*


Unfortunately... they can still get angry and petty, and find a way to fire you if they are that shitty... but who really wants to work for those people, anyway?

Don’t let them convince you you have any obligation to pay for a tab, ever.

 I heard from someone recently that they thought it was a sign of the market in my city cooling down, because they only got one offer on their house. However, that offer was for 12.5% (in this case, $20,000) OVER asking price.

Again, they were the *only* ones to submit an offer.

**They literally gave away twenty thousand dollars over asking price for no reason other than the fear of someone else offering more.** But you can avoid all of that by simply asking your agent to add an escalation clause. With that, you can have your offer automatically go higher and higher, up to a pre-set amount, *if* there are other higher offers on the table.

Guess what, you just saved yourself five figures by *starting* your offer at listing price.

Now, it is of course possible that a seller can simply decide to wait and see if a higher offer comes. But that doesn't automatically disqualify yours. And there are also a lot of sellers who are only ditching their homes because they've already bought another and time is a factor, so they'll take a speedy sale over waiting for a bigger number.

YouShouldKnow,lwp117,YSK to have your dog chase you when it slips it’s leash or harness instead of chasing it,"Why YSK: When your dog gets away from you, chasing it is not always the best idea because they can run fast and far and easily get away from you. Instead, call your dogs name in a playful voice, and say something like “come and get me” and make them think it’s a game, and run in the safest direction for your dog (e.g. away from the street). Your dog is much more likely to think it’s a game and come to you while trying to chase you. 

This is not one size fits all, and dogs have different reactions so practice this first in a controlled setting and get your dog used to chasing you when you initiate, as well as practicing recall. It could save a dogs life.

YouShouldKnow,ltnyy5,"YSK what people make an effort to apologize about sincerely to you, is often actually a reflection of the things that they find most hurtful/frustrating","Why YSK: By paying attention to what people apologize to us for, we can get to know them better, learn their pet peeves, what they value most and what they are most sensitive to. This is especially true for things that don’t seem like a big deal to most people, and *even* more true if that other person already knows we personally don’t find it offensive and still makes it a point to apologize.

If they make an effort to sincerely apologize for something that we, or perhaps most people think of as a non issue (like chewing loudly, being 1-2 minutes late, forgetting to call back, keeping someone waiting, etc...)  they’re likely doing it because they place a high value on not engaging in that behavior and in the reverse they likely would have found it offensive or not ok.

A good example is with being just ever slightly late. If someone makes it a point to *sincerely* apologize to you for being just 1 minute late, and you say to them “oh haha its really not a big deal, no problem”... While it might truly not have bothered you,if they seemed to find apologizing important to you, you should pay attention to that! 

What seems small or irrelevant to us, might be hugely important to someone else, and instead of just shrugging off someone’s apology for something that didn’t seem important or hurtful in our eyes we should see that as that person’s way of indirectly telling us “this is what is important to me” or “this is what I find most hurtful” and use it as a way to deepen and strengthen our relationship with that person.

Edit: I am seeing a lot of posts from people concerned about the dangers of using this insulin. Here are a few points:

1. For those who are truly insulin dependent, this may be critical information. I've seen many people show up to my ED in DKA or HHS because they could not afford insulin. Many were already prescribed a regular + NPH regimen and did not know walmart sold it cheaper. 

2. If you already take a regular, NPH, or 70/30 insulin regimen,  this is the same medication made by Novo Nordisk sold under a different brand name

3. It is true that regular insulin (short acting) is not interchangeable with rapid acting (like lispro). You should only substitute under the direction of your healthcare provider. Call or secure chat message your doctor's office. Usually they will respond quickly with a message from the doctor or a practice nurse. If it's after their business hours and you need insulin, you NEED INSULIN. Ask the licensed pharmacist at the Walmart pharmacy for guidance on how to take it until your doctor can call you back. That's what they're there for. 

4. Pasted below is an article from the Tulane school of medicine on the onset, peak, and duration times of various insulins. As you can see, regular insulin is slower to reach its peak and acts longer, so there's a higher risk of ""stacking insulins,"" and having an unpredictable reaction. Talk to your provider or pharmacist and mind the timing of your insulin administration and meals. Taking insulin incorrectly or when not needed can be dangerous. 
 https://tmedweb.tulane.edu/pharmwiki/doku.php/insulin_regimens

5. Another point: I'm not trying to say that taking some subcutaneous insulin is a way to manage DKA. This knowledge is specifically for insulin-dependent people who require insulin coverage who have NO OTHER CHOICE and would eventually experience a medical emergency if they went without it. To all the people who are saying, ""this isn't the best insulin,"" or ""you need to know how to prevent diabetic emergencies,"" I agree completely. But I have a lot of patients wind up in the ICU on an insulin drip costing thousands because they went without their meal coverage or basal insulin because they couldn't afford it. Root cause analysis: insulin is expensive. This is a stopgap workaround for CERTAIN patients. 

6. I have been informed insulin is not OTC in the state of Indiana. I stand corrected!

Edit: I am seeing a lot of posts from people concerned about the dangers of using this insulin. Here are a few points:

1. For those who are truly insulin dependent, this may be critical information. I've seen many people show up to my ED in DKA or HHS because they could not afford insulin. Many were already prescribed a regular + NPH regimen and did not know walmart sold it cheaper. 

2. If you already take a regular, NPH, or 70/30 insulin regimen,  this is the same medication made by Novo Nordisk sold under a different brand name

3. It is true that regular insulin (short acting) is not interchangeable with rapid acting (like lispro). You should only substitute under the direction of your healthcare provider. Call or secure chat message your doctor's office. Usually they will respond quickly with a message from the doctor or a practice nurse. If it's after their business hours and you need insulin, you NEED INSULIN. Ask the licensed pharmacist at the Walmart pharmacy for guidance on how to take it until your doctor can call you back. That's what they're there for. 

4. Pasted below is an article from the Tulane school of medicine on the onset, peak, and duration times of various insulins. As you can see, regular insulin is slower to reach its peak and acts longer, so there's a higher risk of ""stacking insulins,"" and having an unpredictable reaction. Talk to your provider or pharmacist and mind the timing of your insulin administration and meals. Taking insulin incorrectly or when not needed can be dangerous. 
 

5. Another point: I'm not trying to say that taking some subcutaneous insulin is a way to manage DKA. This knowledge is specifically for insulin-dependent people who require insulin coverage who have NO OTHER CHOICE and would eventually experience a medical emergency if they went without it. To all the people who are saying, ""this isn't the best insulin,"" or ""you need to know how to prevent diabetic emergencies,"" I agree completely. But I have a lot of patients wind up in the ICU on an insulin drip costing thousands because they went without their meal coverage or basal insulin because they couldn't afford it. Root cause analysis: insulin is expensive. This is a stopgap workaround for CERTAIN patients. 

6. I have been informed insulin is not OTC in the state of Indiana. I stand corrected! 

Thank you for the awards. Hopefully the information helps someone out there."

Finding a therapist can be hard. Similar to doctors, there are more competent and less competent individuals. There are specialists who may excel in one area but be clueless in another area.

It saddens me, because I very much believe in the idea of mental health support. There are many stories of wonderful health outcomes. But there are also negative stories.

Finding a therapist can be hard. Similar to doctors, there are more competent and less competent individuals. There are specialists who may excel in one area but be clueless in another area. A lot of therapists tend to be arrogant. The power dynamic is scary - there is very little accountability, outside of professionalism, for a therapist making a client worse.

It saddens me, because I very much believe in the idea of mental health support. There are many stories of wonderful health outcomes. But there are also negative stories.

Finding an effective therapist can be really hard. It's an issue within the field. Part of it could be improved. And part of it is like dating - it helps to find someone you ""click"" with and it can be hard to predict that without trying a few people and risking some bad experiences. 

The challenges of seeking therapy are something more people could/should know."

I was working at an event for a major hotel chain and it was a training class for people moving up the career tract for the chain. They kept drilling this idea “Be interested, no interesting,” when engaging patrons in conversation in their business. 

It seems obvious but I believe it’s a really good idea we should all use when engaging people on conversation, especially new people we meet. I feel as though, to an extent, the “art” of having a conversation is being lost. A lot of the times we are good at talking about ourselves but seldom ask questions of the other person and engage that person.

YouShouldKnow,irykd6,YSK you shouldn’t take puppies under 4 months old to a dog park.,"
Why YSK: it is dangerous for young puppies to go to a dog park because it’s highly likely for them to contract a disease. 

This comes from the last 3 times I went to my local dog park there being not only tiny puppies under 2 months old there, but they were in the pen for dogs over 20 pounds. There is a sign of rules (no dogs under 4 months, no dogs that aren’t fixed, etc) which people regularly ignore. It’s usually not a huge deal, you know maybe once in a blue moon someone brings in an intact male and when he starts getting humpy or rude they leave pretty quickly. 

But these tiny puppies? Look, I get it, you want your puppy to like dogs. You wanna get them socialized. But dog parks are an actual cesspool of disease for unvaccinated dogs- and I say unvacced because puppies don’t get their final round of shots till they’re 3 months old, and it’s usually advised to wait another month for the vaccines to set in before allowing them into an area where lots of other dogs are. Hence the 4 month rule at the park. 

It’s a great place for your puppy to contract parvo, distemper, kennel cough, and whatever the heck else other dogs may carry. My own dog (10 months) got conjunctivitis from the dog park like 3 weeks ago. Some of these diseases are extremely DEADLY for little puppies. And trust me, I see a lot of small puppies come in at work for these things during spring and summer because their owner took them to parks too early. 

It’s just like how you wouldn’t let a brand new human baby lick a toilet in an elementary school. (And I say lick the toilet because puppies lick the ground, other dogs, people, poop, whatever). 

Here’s a quick and to-the-point link about it, with some tips on how to socialize a puppy without taking it to a dog park:[dog park manners ](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/behavior/you-go-dog-park)",1600004788,"you shouldn’t take puppies under 4 months old to a dog park.

YouShouldKnow,hvzx1j,YSK Scrubbing your hands with soap under running water does not clean your hands,"I've seen tons of people who have been rubbing their hands with soap and immediately putting them under the faucet for twenty seconds and counting that as washing their hands. The soap is on their palms for one second before it gets washed away and then they rinse for 20 seconds, so I know they're trying. Germs need contact with the soap to be killed and if you rinse off the soap immediately, you're not really using soap at all. Another thing is that people often use their hands to turn off the water after they just cleaned them, which recontaminates your hands. 

To wash your hands and keep them clean, wet your hands with the tap but then just lather up the soap for twenty seconds. Get under your fingernails, between your fingers, grab your wrists and scrub those too. If you wanna be extra you can get your whole forearms up to your elbows. After that, rinse everything off, dry your hands with a paper towel and then use that paper towel to turn off the water. Chuck the paper towel. That's how I learned it from the food service industry and it works. Also use your elbows to hit light switches/the faucet handles so you don't recontaminate yourself on the way out. 

Edit because I was only thinking about my own bathroom/kitchen sinks: Use a paper towel to open a public bathroom door. If it's push then use your elbow or hip, or just kick gently. If it's pull then it might be a good idea to never use that bathroom or bring napkins in your purse or pockets so you can avoid touching the door handle, which is 100% not being cleaned as frequently as it should be.

Edit because I was only thinking about my own bathroom/kitchen sinks: Use a paper towel to open a public bathroom door. If it's push then use your elbow or hip, or just kick gently. If it's pull then it might be a good idea to never use that bathroom or bring napkins in your purse or pockets so you can avoid touching the door handle, which is 100% not being cleaned as frequently as it should be.

Just scrubbing is better than nothing, but stop rinsing your mouth after (and don't eat or drink right after either) and you'll see a surprising difference over time.

YouShouldKnow,hur09k,YSK that the hymen is not an indicator of virginity and that it is NOT normal for sex to hurt,"I find it frustrating that even today you see things about how a woman having a hymen means she's a virgin. Or how it's ""normal"" for sex to hurt, especially the first time. No and no! If sex hurts, speak to a doctor. It shouldn't hurt, even the first time.

Gynecologist Jennifer Gunter explained this best (the sub won't let me link):

""The hymen is a left over collection of cells that typically partially occludes the vaginal opening. Many mammals have hymen. Humans, dogs, cats, camels, elephants etc. if this were for marriage/a social construct of virginity then other mammals would not have them. 

The hymen is more rigid at birth and provides more covering for the first 3 years to keep urine and feces out of the infant vagina, which lacks estrogen so is very sensitive to irritants. 

When most children become continent coincides with the time the hymen starts to take on different shapes and flexibility because evolution no longer cares. 

Yes, the hymen is like baby teeth. It served a biological purpose for a narrow developmental window and then when no longer needed is discarded. 

The hymen is no virginity indicator, 50% of sexually active teens do not have a disrupted hymen. The hymen is often very flexible. 

What about blood stained sheets on the wedding night? 2/3 of women have no bleeding with first coitus and for those who do it is usually spotting. The hymen does not have a rich blood supply. Blood stained sheets come from sexual trauma. 

Also 2/3 of women have no pain with first coitus. 

Some people think the hymen would tell a man if the wedding night baby was his. Um, no. Chance of conception from single act of sex 2-5%, for most of evolution mortality in 1st year very high. Evolution doesn’t invest in 1-2.5% chances. Also, if paternity were evolutionarily so important, why invest in the first baby only? Or why not have an elephant’s hymen that only breaks in childbirth? 

The hymen means nothing physically and hymen exams are medically not a thing and are unnecessary. And support a disgusting patriarchal trope.""

YouShouldKnow,gzq3bq,YSK: Password Best Practices,"I graduated from and work in cybersecurity. A good portion of my job is training the employees to the companies we are contracted to. Things like spotting malicious e-mails, social engineering, etc.

One area that everyone seems to think they are great in, but usually aren't, is passwords. One example I do in my training is put up a series of password pairs and ask the audience which password is ""stronger"" (depending on the clientele, I'll go into what hashing is and do demonstrations of cracking). The results always surprise me.

One of our SOC auditors wasn't even aware that NIST had updated their [guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) a few years ago. I think this speaks to how comfortable we all think we are with passwords, *when we really shouldn't be.*

Now a days, your password is the key to your life. There are more malicious actors now than ever, using more sophisticated tools than ever. You should know how you can help protect yourself, starting with password hygiene.

**Password Patterns (Avoid These):**

* 77% of passwords containing a single digit append it to the end of their password. 10% of the time, an appended digit will be a ""1"" (includes data where more than one digit was appended). If the password has capitals, 15% of the time it will be a ""1"" ^(\[2\]). Adding a 1 to the end of your password has become effectively meaningless for your security.
* To clarify the above regarding the 10% figure: The data set has passwords with varying number of digits (""pass123"", ""pass2134325"", ""pass1"", etc.). Of *all* passwords which have *any number* digits appended, 10% of those only append a single ""1"".
* 35% of passwords requiring a capital letter will capitalize the first letter ^(\[2\]).
* 89% of 7-character long alpha strings can be targeted by either capitalizing the first character or capitalizing the whole string^(\[2\]).
* 61% of passwords are the exact length of the minimum length set in the password policy^(\[3\])\*.
* \~10% of users will model their password after their username^(\[3\]). ([john.smith@company.com](mailto:john.smith@company.com):Jsmith1)

**Things to Keep in Mind When Creating a Password:**

* Length is *more important* than complexity^(\[1\]) . This does not mean complexity is not important, just that length is *more* important. Shoot for length first, then complexity.
* Avoid common substitutions, as they are baked into [password cracking rule-sets](https://github.com/praetorian-code/Hob0Rules). Common substitutions include: a = @, i = !, s = $, etc. Same with adding a 1 to the end of your password and capitalizing the first character. These are common patterns, and are well-known to crackers.
* Instead of thinking ""password"" think ""passphrase"". A single dictionary word is extremely bad. Four to five random dictionary words, perhaps separated by spaces or special characters, is robust. *The benefit of a passphrase is that it is easier for you to generate entropy while still remembering your key. Generating entropy through randomized characters is hard, and results in a hard to remember password, meaning you will likely end up with less entropy.*
* Avoid ""password walking"". This is using a password with adjacent keyboard characters (e.g. ""qwerty"", ""1q2w3e4r"", ""1qaz2wsx"", etc.)
* Avoid any password present on a password blacklist^(\[4\]). Ideally, this should be a baked-in process.

**Passwords in General:**

* You should be using a different password for *every* website. At the very least, your e-mail password should be extremely strong and unique. If someone gets into your e-mail, they can simply reset every other password connected to that e-mail, regardless of how strong they are. Password re-use attacks are common^(\[5\]). *I cannot overstate the importance of this one tip.*
* SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is better than nothing, but [sim-swapping](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/sim-swap-fraud-explained/) has made it inferior to other forms of 2FA and MFA.
* I, and my colleagues, and many others **strongly recommend a** (non-browser-based, audited) **password manager**. There still seems to be debate about password managers. I will only comment that most security professionals and government agencies encourage the use of them^(\[6, 7, 8, 9, 10\]). *They are not a panacea. Use them in combination with other positive security habits, like frequent backups and 2FA/MFA.*

**For developers and/or administrators:**

* Ditch password resets. There is ample evidence now that users change their passwords in predictable patterns (password1 -&gt; password2 -&gt; password3 -&gt; pa$$word1 -&gt; etc.). Additionally, if users know that they will have to change their passwords, they are more likely to create a weaker -- but more memorable -- password. Passwords should only be force-changed at signs of compromise. Overall, effectiveness of password expiration in meeting its intended goal is weak^(\[11\]).
* Drop the complexity song and dance. These restrictions will often force users into following one of the above exposed patterns of password creation, and there is little evidence that they increase password robustness (as they are currently implemented).\*\* The ""inventor"" of password complexity rules has even apologized and admitted there wasn't much empirical data on password security at the time he implemented the rules^(\[12\]).
* Allow paste in password fields. This is less of a problem now, but there are still applications and websites which don't allow pasted passwords. Password managers are more ubiquitous each day. Don't discourage it.
* Check user passwords against an up-to-date blacklist of common/compromised passwords. There are several tools and implementations to accomplish this.

**Tools and Resources:**

* [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a resource where you enter your e-mail to see if it has appeared in any known breaches catalogued by the website.
* [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) is a free and open-source software token for 2FA.
* [NIST 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)

\-----------

\* Knowing the minimum length required by policy, and knowing that 61% of passwords are that length will significantly increase the speed of password cracking.

\*\* There is ongoing research into the benefits of having multiple rules in a ""pool"", of which a few are randomly selected to be applied on a user-to-user basis. (e.g. Alice must include a number and be a minimum length of 10 characters. Bob must include a special character and a minimum length of 9 characters).

Edit: I'll just go ahead and add that **the way I always dealt with this was putting a barrier of  diatomaceous  earth** around the inner and outer perimeter of my house (especially along that space where the wall meets the floor). It's cheap, pretty non-toxic, and not smelly. The stuff is safe powder for us, but for ants it's like trying to walk across broken glass, so it's like an impenetrable barrier to them. And any that do walk across it get ded because their bodies fall apart when they walk on it.

Edit 2: Another user pointed out that if you have a recurring problem with ants, you should really just have a pest control person to come out and see where they're coming from so you can solve the problem once and for all. That's probably best advice if you can afford it.

Edit 3: Some sources about the salt thing. Apparently the further you are from the ocean, the more ants will seek out salt. Makes sense, really.

YouShouldKnow,gz7r8p,"YSK Recycling is not as good for the environment as it is made out to be, and should only be used once more sustainable options have been exhausted.","When discussing sustainability there is a massive focus on recycling and while a focus on sustainability is good, recycling was never intended to be a top priority. Recycling is often overprioritized and overused, which may result in a net negative effect on the environment due to shipping processes used.

In reality, recycling is intended to be used as a small part of a larger strategy, referred to as ""reduce reuse recycle"". this is intended as a list of steps/priorities in which recycling comes last. Recycling is last because it is the last resort, and only slightly better than throwing things away. In fact, only 9.1% of plastic sent to be recycled actually gets recycled, the rest is wasted. Before recycling, you should first try to reduce your consumption, reuse what items you can, and if something must be disposed of, see if it can be recycled.

For example:

1. Reduce: Rather than buying a pack of water bottles, only buy one or two reusable ones.
2. Reuse: Once the bottle is empty, fill it up again.
3. Recycle: If the bottle is no longer usable for some reason, recycle it.

Some tips:

1. Durable and long-lasting products are more cost-effective and cleaner (LED bulbs).
2. Maintaining, and replacing small parts is better than replacing an entire device (adding new parts to an old computer). Internet tutorials can help with this stuff.
3. Large containers produce less waste (buying in bulk).

Edit: Other things to take into consideration:

1. Paper and cardboard can often be composted or recycled very effectively, making it a great material for items that must be disposable.
2. Metals are great. Not only can they be reused for long periods of time, they can also be recycled efficiently if needed. Some places may even pay for items such as cans.
3. Reuse often saves money, despite the increased cost upfront. For example, a $6 1000 cycle AA battery, would save you $294 over its lifetime when compared to a 30 cent disposable battery.
4. Selling or donating items such as old electronics ensures that they are reused, and reduces the need for more items to be manufactured.

YouShouldKnow,g1u6pq,"YSK the difference between ""everyday"" and ""every day."" People get it wrong all the time.","I just got an email from a multinational company that is a perfect example of how to use both correctly in one sentence:

&gt; [Company Name] Cares – **Everyday** heroes and **every day** at home

""Everyday"" (one word) is an adjective that describes something typical.

""Every day"" (two words) is a phrase that describes something happening on a daily basis. 

Here are some examples of incorrect usage (the most common errors I see):

* I visit my grandma everyday. -&gt; should read: I visit my grandma every day.
* I go to school everyday.  -&gt; should read: I go to school every day.
* I eat lunch everyday. -&gt; should read: I eat lunch every day.

Oddly, most people don't seem to make the error the other way around, substituting the two-word form where it should have been a one-word form. 

One-word vs two-word forms also distinguish what we call ""verb phrases"" and nouns. For example, ""login"" and ""log in"" have distinctly different purposes and usages. Many websites, reddit included, mislabel their links/buttons. That ""logout"" button in the top-right corner of the screen? Wrong. It should read ""log out."" ""Logout"" isn't a word (though ""login"" is).

You ""log in"" to a website (used as a verb) by entering your ""login"" (a noun). Your login is your username and password. Think of it this way: You don't ""login"" to a website, in the same sense that you wouldn't say ""I loggedin to reddit."" No, you ""logged in,"" because you ""log in.""

YouShouldKnow,g1r4kb,"YSK that you’re probably picking snails up wrong. You shouldn’t lift them straight up as this can cause mantle collapse, which can cause the snail a very painful death. You should gently slide them until they detach from the surface, or poke them until they contract into the shell then lift them up.","The mantle is a muscle that holds the body to the shell and is responsible for keeping the shape of the snail inside the shell. It is a delicate sac containing vital organs, including the lung and gills. Normally the mantle is expanded to meet the outer lip of the shell and you can see it encroaching and sometimes covering the columella. 

If you keep pet snails or are rescuing them from a pavement for example, you should either slide them and get lift them off a smooth surface, or poke the shell gently until they retreat then lifted them that way. Pulling them directly up when the foot is attached to the surface can cause mantle collapse. The mantle can either tear away from where it is connected to the shell or collapse entirely. Tears can heal quite quickly, because the snails can seem largely unaffected. They can still move around and eat, so it isn't long before they heal.

However, if the mantle collapses the snail probably won’t survive. A collapsed mantle looks like a sock covering the body. You can see over the rim and right down into the shell. The snail (when extended) looks strange and struggles to pull its shell around. It also struggles to retract as it has no real cavity to invaginate into. The collapse puts quite a bit of pressure on the lung as the breathing cavity is restricted. The snail often suffocates, or starves. Mantle collapse can sometimes be healable, depending to the degree of collapse, but it takes much longer because it is difficult to get the snail to eat/breathe properly. 

If you keep pet snails and notice one showing signs of mantle collapse, you should use clove oil as an anaesthetic, then freeze it so it is safely and humanely euthanised. If you don’t, the snail will probably suffer a terribly painful death as it can starve or suffocate, and cannot retreat into its shell for comfort and protection.

[Edit: man, I’m speechless but pleasantly surprised this post blew up! I come back a couple hours later and I have hundreds of comments to sift through and upvote! I hope it saves a few snails :) I just wanted to say thank you to all my snail saving comrades, and please don’t feel guilty if you accidentally damaged them whilst trying to save them.

YouShouldKnow,drl2c5,YSK that unemployment is low in the US and UK only because 'involuntary' part-time work is high,"Both the US and UK are claiming to have record-breaking lows for unemployment. However, both ignore how this miracle was achieved: unemployment is only at a record low because of a 42% increase in the number of people who are in ""involuntary"" part-time work. 

""Involuntary"" means they're only working part-time because they cannot get a full-time job.

If ""involuntary"" part-timers were reclassified as ""unemployed"" - on the logic that they are unemployed for a majority of their week - then, for example, the UK unemployment rate would be 7%, rather than 4% as it claims. The total number of ""unemployed"" people would be 2.2 million, not 1.4 million.

Four percent unemployment is technically ""full employment,"" meaning anyone who wants a job should be able to get one. But workers need full-time jobs - the kind that get people out of poverty - and those jobs are not available.

Why does this matter? Full-time work, in the form of a 40-hour work week with overtime and promotions, is the way that working people prosper. As many of us unfortunately know from experience, it is extremely difficult to buy a house or raise a family if you're on less than 40 hours a week, or if your job is only temporary. Yet part-time jobs are a growing long-term trend.

Trucks have a heavy load behind them. They are aware of that, which is why they leave plenty of room in front of them from the car in front of them. If they need to break for any reason, that cushion keeps everyone safe. When you invade that space after you pass a truck, you cause the truck to need to slow down to adjust their cushion. Unless you plan to immediately floor it, you have created a domino effect, because the car behind the truck now has to slow down, or get in another lane. Everyone complains about traffic, but this is what can cause traffic. 

If the weather is bad, that truck needs the room even moreso, and extra room. Be aware that you may want to leave 8 car lengths between you and the truck.

   It is not known why it's present on someone, and not on others, or what is the purpose of these papules. They are mistaken for HPV papules often, but these won't hurt or cause any discomfort.

   Mostly, doctors are not advising it's removal, but there are numerous procedures for it. If you really don't like it being there, you can consult your doctor about it.

   And obligatory warning: if you feel like that something does not right ""down there"", or you are concerned about it, get your courage and go to a doctor. If you have problems with your genitalia, like:

* itching
* burning feeling
* rash on the head of your penis
* it's red and/or inflammed
* it's foul-smelling
* or it's generally causing discomfort  
**you should gotta go and see a doctor.** It won't be the best minutes of your life, but you could get treated in time if you happen to have an infection, instead of getting diagnosed in the last minute.

Exact description from Wikipedia: ""The papules appear as one or several rows of small, pearly or  flesh-colored, smooth, dome-topped bumps situated circumferentially  around the [corona]( or sulcus of the glans. They may range in size from less than 1 mm to 3 mm. As of 1999, different studies have produced estimates of incidence ranging from 8 to 48 percent of all men."" (Source: [Wikipedia](, **NSFW** images)

   Mostly, doctors are not advising it's removal, but there are numerous procedures for it. If you really don't like it being there, you can consult your doctor about it.

   And obligatory warning: if you feel like that something does not right ""down there"", or you are concerned about it, get your courage and go to a doctor. If you have problems with your genitalia, like:

* itching
* burning feeling
* rash on the head of your penis
* it's red and/or inflammed
* it's foul-smelling
* or it's generally causing discomfort  
**you should gotta go and see a doctor.** It won't be the best minutes of your life, but you could get treated in time if you happen to have an infection, instead of getting diagnosed in the last minute.

YouShouldKnow,dmzmoo,YSK you need to literally be a millionaire if you plan to retire off a 401K,"Say you were 65 years old today and you wanted to live off the average salary in America in 2019 (~56,000) how much money would you need in an investment account?

for a 98% chance on not going broke until you die you would need an amount of money invested in a balanced account (50/50 stocks/bonds) in which 4% of that would equal $56,000. That 4% is called a withdrawal rate and is derived from hundreds of researchers back testing millions of scenarios to determine how much money you need to retire from.

Ignoring any social security benefit that would mean you need approximately 1,400,000 (56,000/.04) in an investment account today to retire off 56,000 a year. Luckily Americans have some sort of social security benefit. In January of 2019 the average SS benefit was 1,368 per month (16,416 per year). Netting out SS you would need an account that could handle 4% withdrawal to match 39,584 per year which is $989,600.

These are all pre-tax numbers which I'm not going to go down that hole.

In summary TODAY if you receive 16,000 from social security you still need approximately 1 million dollars in an investment account to receive ~56,000 **pre-tax** income in retirement.

If you are reading this and are 25 you have, on the low end, another 40 years until you retire. If inflation is 3% for the next 40 years (that includes housing which has well surpassed that in recent history) your retirement income would need to be $182,700 in 2060 to have the same purchasing power at $56,000 today. That would mean with a 4% withdrawal rate you need a little over $4,500,000 in an investment account in 2060 making you a multi-millionaire on paper. All of this is to only match the purchasing power of $56,000 in 2019.

Young people today should know this is uncharted territory, never before in modern America has an entire generation been so reliant on self investment. The previous pension model proved to be unsustainable but afforded previous generations with guaranteed income in retirement and for better or worse had required payments by the employee into the pension fund for the company.

Today employees are sometimes incentivized via matching to invest in a 401K but are never required to contribute and it is not uncommon, especially by those at most risk (blue collar workers), to not contribute to their retirement in the 20's and most of their 30's. A time in which the power of compounding interest will help them the most in achieving their goal. Every dollar invested today is worth ~$30 40 years from now but if you wait 20 years to start investing that 1 dollar is only worth $5.

TL;DR You need WAY more money than you probably realize to retire earning a lot less money than you'd think. Since you cant start yesterday, start today.

This story is long, so I will include a TLDR; at the beginning. If you or someone you know is included in the title subject group, I encourage you to read this. In-text citations are included and a reference list is at the bottom (APA6 for those who care).  


# TLDR: 

***Fifth Generation Ford Explorers have a problem dating back to 2011 with exhaust leaking into the cabin. Ford claims to have fixed it but it hasn't. This has caused accidents, lawsuits, and a large potential scandal to be swept under the rug.***

# INTRODUCTION

I am writing this post as a precautionary tale to others who may be in my shoes. I own a 2013 Ford Explorer Limited 4WD with 110,000 miles on it. On Friday my wife complained of a migraine, which happens from time to time. On Saturday, the migraine was so bad she had to go to the ER. Her Check Engine light came on by Monday, at which point she took it to a trusted mechanic who read the code and told her that one of her catalytic converters was going out.

For those that don't know,  ""a **catalytic converter** is a device that uses a catalyst to convert three harmful compounds in car exhaust into harmless compounds"" (HowStuffWorks, 2019). According to Popely (2019), a catalytic converter should last 10 years. This equates out to around 160,000-185,000 miles. The fact that this was failing after 6 years and 110,000 miles was a big problem. If a catalytic converter fails, it's usually a severe symptom of something else in the engine going wrong.

That same Monday, she noticed an odd smell in her car, something she described as a permanent marker type smell. The mechanic informed her that this was carbon monoxide and extremely dangerous. For those that don't know, according to The Mayo Clinic (2019), 

&gt;Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide builds up in your bloodstream. When too much carbon monoxide is in the air, your body replaces the oxygen in your red blood cells with carbon monoxide. This can lead to serious tissue damage, or even death.  
&gt;  
&gt;Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas produced by burning gasoline, wood, propane, charcoal or other fuel. Improperly ventilated appliances and engines, particularly in a tightly sealed or enclosed space, may allow carbon monoxide to accumulate to dangerous levels.

The symptoms of CO Poisoning include: 

* Dull headache
* Weakness
* Dizziness
* Nausea or vomiting
* Shortness of breath
* Confusion
* Blurred vision
* Loss of consciousness

Carbon Monoxide does not simply leave your body as soon as you hit fresh air. Brain damage can occur and effects can happen even after leaving the CO filled environment. My wife was a sufferer of migraines but had taken steps to mitigate them, so it startled us that they had been reoccurring in recent months. I was looking online about this and found this was a **systemic problem to the fifth generation Explorer that Ford simply doesn't know how to fix**. 

# Known Cases

Since 2016, the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration (NHSTA) has been investigating this problem. As far as I can tell, the problem was first detected in the Police Interceptor model of the Ford Explorer (in commercial use) with incidents such as  (Martyn, 2019) :

* A Newport Beach, CA Officer passing out while driving, which led to him crashing into a tree.
* An Auburn, MA officer also passing out while driving, rear-ending another vehicle (the department claims 4 officers have experienced CO poisoning).
* A Henderson, LA officer losing consciousness and flipping her vehicle.
* Five Austin, TX officers experiencing CO poisoning over a period of four days, leading to the department pulling 400 Explorer patrol vehicles from service.
* Additionally, a Fall River, MA officer was hospitalized for CO poisoning in his cruiser (San Miguel, n.d.).
* Furthermore, six Washington state troopers filed suit against Ford after receiving CO poisoning (Howard, 2019).

HOWEVER, the actual discovery of the problem dates back to 2011, when a Ford employee discovered this. Ford stated that they found ""the circumstances needed to recreate the problem to be outside of typical customer use,"" (Hyatt, 2019).

For its part, Ford blamed the Police Departments, citing modifications found that were not factory standard. However,  Ford does not have an explanation for the over 1,300 civilian complaints made to the NHSTA regarding the same problem.

Furthermore, ""Captain James Thibodeaux of the Henderson Police Department responds that Ford has never inspected the Explorer involved in the crash that injured his officer. He says that the automaker contacted the police department’s insurer about arranging an inspection, but has yet to do so. As for Ford’s blaming the carbon monoxide leak on vehicle modifications, 'they can’t make that determination from this point at the case because they haven’t looked at the vehicle,'"" (Martyn, 2019). 

The Center for Auto Safety has pressured Ford to initiate a recall for the 1.3 million Explorers sold in that period, citing the over 1,300 documented cases. The NHSTA has stated it has received over 2,000 complaints as well that might be related to the exhaust problems because they mention ""an exhaust smell, burning eyes, drowsiness, headaches, and nausea"" (Riddle, 2019).

Although Ford has repeatedly denied responsibility, ""Ford has reportedly issued technical service bulletins that pertain to the issue. The manufacturer acknowledged in a deposition that there appears to be a “design issue” that is still being evaluated"" (Smith, n.d.). This slipped out in arbitration for one of the more than 50 legal grievances filed against the company (Beene, 2019):

&gt;Ford representative Bob Gray testifying in January 2015 that the Cassidys (one of the plaintiffs) couldn’t pursue warranty claims because the company had tried but couldn’t solve the problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s a design issue, not a defect,” Gray told the arbitrator, according to a transcript of the proceeding. “The fact that it’s being reported across the large number of vehicles would show that it’s not a defect in this particular vehicle.”

Ford quickly backpedaled, distancing themselves from the representative and saying that he misspoke and there were no design problems. 

HOWEVER, another Ford representative in the Washington State Trooper lawsuit said this:

""During a Florida Better Business Bureau proceeding on Jan. 2, 2015, Ford's representative said, ""We do feel that it's a design issue, not a defect ... It's simply a vent leading somewhere where it doesn't need to be; and, you know, it's just being set in a certain way that's — that's allowing it to draw it into the — into the vehicle,"" according to a transcript cited in the Washington State lawsuit"" (Howard, 2019). 

Ford backpedaled on this as well, once again citing the safety of their vehicles and a representative misspeaking. 

# What is this design issue? TO be honest, no one is exactly sure. 

While Ford says that its vehicles are perfectly safe, ""a police department in Montgomery County, Maryland has found that some vehicles have cracked exhaust manifolds, which is a part of the car that goes from the engine to the tailpipe"" (Eklund, 2019). 

This is supported by the NHTSA, according to Levine (2019),  ""In July 2017, NHTSA indicated the most likely culprit for the exposure of Ford consumers to potentially lethal amounts of Carbon Monoxide was cracked exhaust manifolds.""

""The leaks were mostly found in the exhaust manifold and the catalytic converter, which in the Explorer are welded together to form a single part. Problems identified in the records included porous welds, cracks and poor fits with other components that allowed exhaust to escape before exiting the tailpipe,"" (Beene, 2019). 

Furthermore, the probe into this from the NHTSA has not included 2018 models, although complaints have been registered about those as well. 

# Did Ford do ANYTHING?

Ford implemented a program in 2017 that it said fixed the problem, with Explorer owners complaining of exhaust odors being able to bring their vehicle into a Ford dealership. Dealers will reprogram the air conditioner, replace the liftgate drain valves, and inspect the sealing at the rear of the vehicles, Ford said. All work will be done free of charge. This program expired on 31 December 2018. 

According to Levine, (2019), ""Ford issued a Customer Service Program (CSP-17N03) focused on less expensive and potentially less effective repairs such as reapplying weather sealant and reprogramming the climate control in order to give customers “peace of mind” but stated the “vehicles are safe.” The CSP did not vary dramatically from previous technical bulletins Ford has quietly been issuing since 2012 to address the same issue (See: [TSB 14-0130](http://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TSB-14-0130.pdf), and [TSB 16-016](http://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TSB-16-0166.pdf).).""

Additionally,  if you didn't know (we sure didn't) (Beene, 2019):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As part of a 2016 deal to resolve a national class-action lawsuit alleging carbon monoxide problems in 2011-2015 Explorers. That nationwide settlement, which was finalized last September, provided $175 to $500 to customers who paid for repairs that didn’t work; extended warranties for the exhaust issue; and required Ford to issue a new bulletin to dealerships recommending repairs, which it did. In the settlement agreement, Ford didn’t admit to any liability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Drivers of 2016 and 2017 Explorers not covered by that settlement filed a separate case seeking class-action status in federal court in Detroit in October 2017. That case is ongoing. Meanwhile, proposed class-action suits have been filed in federal courts in New York State and New Jersey, both on behalf of law enforcement personnel who used Police Interceptor models.

Ford also did a buyback on approximately 100 of these Explorers as a ""goodwill gesture"", although they are not all completed and the owners are still using the Explorers, albeit with CO monitors. 

# Why not a recall?

While NHTSA has not finished its investigation and has not ordered a recall, other aforementioned groups have called on Ford to execute one. However, this recall would be in the seven figures and likely cost Ford somewhere in the hundreds of millions of dollars neighborhood. 

As an example of how costly recalls are, (Beene, 2019): 

&gt;Recalling the 1.3 million fifth-generation Explorers would be costly, but precise estimates are hard to come by—chiefly because it’s unclear what any fix might entail if NHTSA requires a new one. For context: Ford said in September that it would take a $140 million charge to recall around 2 million F-150s for faulty seatbelt components that could cause fires. In 2017, the company took a $267 million charge to recall 1.3 million F-Series pickup trucks in the U.S., Canada and Mexico to correct faulty door latches. 

# Did the ""Fix"" work?

Short answer: No. The Center for Auto Safety has received multiple complaints from consumers **after** they got the ""fix"", according to Levine (2019). Jason Levine is the Executive Director for the Center for Auto Safety and says that "" Ford owners continue to file complaints with NHTSA about exposure to exhaust and carbon monoxide in their Explorers. Scores of consumers, even after receiving their “peace of mind” fix, continue to report experiencing the same symptoms as before their visit to the Ford dealership.""

# Silver Linings

According to Hyatt (2019), ""the good news, if there is any in all this, is that Ford is introducing an all-new Explorer for the 2020 model year, and the powertrain and exhaust setup are not being carried over wholesale."" Even still, this is a company that is actively choosing to ignore a problem it discovered in 2011 and not do a recall. I know that I will never trust Ford again, and I am trading it in (with full disclosure to the dealer) tomorrow.

*Caveat: While some reports have said this resolved the issue (Beene, 2019), further reading states that complaints persist (Hyatt, 2019). The free fix program concluded on 31 December 2018*

# TLDR: 

***Fifth Generation Ford Explorers have a problem dating back to 2011 with exhaust leaking into the cabin. Ford claims to have fixed it but it hasn't. This has caused accidents, lawsuits, and a large potential scandal to be swept under the rug.***

# INTRODUCTION

I am writing this post as a precautionary tale to others who may be in my shoes. I own a 2013 Ford Explorer Limited 4WD with 110k miles on it. On Friday my wife complained of a migraine, which happens from time to time. On Saturday, the migraine was so bad she had to go to the ER. Her Check Engine light came on by Monday, at which point she took it to a trusted mechanic who read the code and told her that one of her catalytic converters was going out.

For those that don't know,  ""a **catalytic converter** is a device that uses a catalyst to convert three harmful compounds in car exhaust into harmless compounds"" (HowStuffWorks, 2019). According to Popely (2019), a catalytic converter should last 10 years. This equates out to around 160k-185k miles. The fact that this was failing after 6 years and 110k miles was a big problem. If a catalytic converter fails, it's usually a severe symptom of something else in the engine going wrong.

That same Monday, she noticed an odd smell in her car, something she described as a permanent marker type smell. The mechanic informed her that this was carbon monoxide and extremely dangerous. For those that don't know, according to The Mayo Clinic (2019), 

&gt;Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide builds up in your bloodstream. When too much carbon monoxide is in the air, your body replaces the oxygen in your red blood cells with carbon monoxide. This can lead to serious tissue damage, or even death.  
&gt;  
&gt;Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas produced by burning gasoline, wood, propane, charcoal or other fuel. Improperly ventilated appliances and engines, particularly in a tightly sealed or enclosed space, may allow carbon monoxide to accumulate to dangerous levels.

The symptoms of CO Poisoning include: 

* Dull headache
* Weakness
* Dizziness
* Nausea or vomiting
* Shortness of breath
* Confusion
* Blurred vision
* Loss of consciousness

Carbon Monoxide does not simply leave your body as soon as you hit fresh air. Brain damage can occur and effects can happen even after leaving the CO filled environment. My wife was a sufferer of migraines but had taken steps to mitigate them, so it startled us that they had been reoccurring in recent months. I was looking online about this and found this was a **systemic problem to the fifth generation Explorer that Ford simply doesn't know how to fix**. 

# Known Cases

Since 2016, the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration (NHSTA) has been investigating this problem. As far as I can tell, the problem was first detected in the Police Interceptor model of the Ford Explorer (in commercial use) with incidents such as  (Martyn, 2019) :

* A Newport Beach, CA Officer passing out while driving, which led to him crashing into a tree.
* An Auburn, MA officer also passing out while driving, rear-ending another vehicle (the department claims 4 officers have experienced CO poisoning).
* A Henderson, LA officer losing consciousness and flipping her vehicle.
* Five Austin, TX officers experiencing CO poisoning over a period of four days, leading to the department pulling 400 Explorer patrol vehicles from service.
* Additionally, a Fall River, MA officer was hospitalized for CO poisoning in his cruiser (San Miguel, n.d.).
* Furthermore, six Washington state troopers filed suit against Ford after receiving CO poisoning (Howard, 2019).

HOWEVER, the actual discovery of the problem dates back to 2011, when a Ford employee discovered this. Ford stated that they found ""the circumstances needed to recreate the problem to be outside of typical customer use,"" (Hyatt, 2019).

For its part, Ford blamed the Police Departments, citing modifications found that were not factory standard. However,  Ford does not have an explanation for the over 1,300 civilian complaints made to the NHSTA regarding the same problem.

Furthermore, ""Captain James Thibodeaux of the Henderson Police Department responds that Ford has never inspected the Explorer involved in the crash that injured his officer. He says that the automaker contacted the police department’s insurer about arranging an inspection, but has yet to do so. As for Ford’s blaming the carbon monoxide leak on vehicle modifications, 'they can’t make that determination from this point at the case because they haven’t looked at the vehicle,'"" (Martyn, 2019). 

The Center for Auto Safety has pressured Ford to initiate a recall for the 1.3 million Explorers sold in that period, citing the over 1,300 documented cases. The NHSTA has stated it has received over 2k complaints as well that might be related to the exhaust problems because they mention ""an exhaust smell, burning eyes, drowsiness, headaches, and nausea"" (Riddle, 2019).

Although Ford has repeatedly denied responsibility, ""Ford has reportedly issued technical service bulletins that pertain to the issue. The manufacturer acknowledged in a deposition that there appears to be a “design issue” that is still being evaluated"" (Smith, n.d.). This slipped out in arbitration for one of the more than 50 legal grievances filed against the company (Beene, 2019):

&gt;Ford representative Bob Gray testifying in January 2015 that the Cassidys (one of the plaintiffs) couldn’t pursue warranty claims because the company had tried but couldn’t solve the problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s a design issue, not a defect,” Gray told the arbitrator, according to a transcript of the proceeding. “The fact that it’s being reported across the large number of vehicles would show that it’s not a defect in this particular vehicle.”

Ford quickly backpedaled, distancing themselves from the representative and saying that he misspoke and there were no design problems. 

HOWEVER, another Ford representative in the Washington State Trooper lawsuit said this:

""During a Florida Better Business Bureau proceeding on Jan. 2, 2015, Ford's representative said, ""We do feel that it's a design issue, not a defect ... It's simply a vent leading somewhere where it doesn't need to be; and, you know, it's just being set in a certain way that's — that's allowing it to draw it into the — into the vehicle,"" according to a transcript cited in the Washington State lawsuit"" (Howard, 2019). 

Ford backpedaled on this as well, once again citing the safety of their vehicles and a representative misspeaking. 

# What is this design issue? TO be honest, no one is exactly sure. 

While Ford says that its vehicles are perfectly safe, ""a police department in Montgomery County, Maryland has found that some vehicles have cracked exhaust manifolds, which is a part of the car that goes from the engine to the tailpipe"" (Eklund, 2019). 

This is supported by the NHTSA, according to Levine (2019),  ""In July 2017, NHTSA indicated the most likely culprit for the exposure of Ford consumers to potentially lethal amounts of Carbon Monoxide was cracked exhaust manifolds.""

""The leaks were mostly found in the exhaust manifold and the catalytic converter, which in the Explorer are welded together to form a single part. Problems identified in the records included porous welds, cracks and poor fits with other components that allowed exhaust to escape before exiting the tailpipe,"" (Beene, 2019). 

Furthermore, the probe into this from the NHTSA has not included 2018 models, although complaints have been registered about those as well. 

# Did Ford do ANYTHING?

Ford implemented a program in 2017 that it said fixed the problem, with Explorer owners complaining of exhaust odors being able to bring their vehicle into a Ford dealership. Dealers will reprogram the air conditioner, replace the liftgate drain valves, and inspect the sealing at the rear of the vehicles, Ford said. All work will be done free of charge. This program expired on 31 December 2018. 

According to Levine, (2019), ""Ford issued a Customer Service Program (CSP-17N03) focused on less expensive and potentially less effective repairs such as reapplying weather sealant and reprogramming the climate control in order to give customers “peace of mind” but stated the “vehicles are safe.” The CSP did not vary dramatically from previous technical bulletins Ford has quietly been issuing since 2012 to address the same issue (See: [TSB 14-0130](, and [TSB 16-016](""

Additionally,  if you didn't know (we sure didn't) (Beene, 2019):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As part of a 2016 deal to resolve a national class-action lawsuit alleging carbon monoxide problems in 2011-2015 Explorers. That nationwide settlement, which was finalized last September, provided $175 to $500 to customers who paid for repairs that didn’t work; extended warranties for the exhaust issue; and required Ford to issue a new bulletin to dealerships recommending repairs, which it did. In the settlement agreement, Ford didn’t admit to any liability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Drivers of 2016 and 2017 Explorers not covered by that settlement filed a separate case seeking class-action status in federal court in Detroit in October 2017. That case is ongoing. Meanwhile, proposed class-action suits have been filed in federal courts in New York State and New Jersey, both on behalf of law enforcement personnel who used Police Interceptor models.

Ford also did a buyback on approximately 100 of these Explorers as a ""goodwill gesture"", although they are not all completed and the owners are still using the Explorers, albeit with CO monitors. 

# Why not a recall?

While NHTSA has not finished its investigation and has not ordered a recall, other aforementioned groups have called on Ford to execute one. However, this recall would be in the seven figures and likely cost Ford somewhere in the hundreds of millions of dollars neighborhood. 

As an example of how costly recalls are, (Beene, 2019): 

&gt;Recalling the 1.3 million fifth-generation Explorers would be costly, but precise estimates are hard to come by—chiefly because it’s unclear what any fix might entail if NHTSA requires a new one. For context: Ford said in September that it would take a $140 million charge to recall around 2 million F-150s for faulty seatbelt components that could cause fires. In 2017, the company took a $267 million charge to recall 1.3 million F-Series pickup trucks in the U.S., Canada and Mexico to correct faulty door latches. 

# Did the ""Fix"" work?

Short answer: No. The Center for Auto Safety has received multiple complaints from consumers **after** they got the ""fix"", according to Levine (2019). Jason Levine is the Executive Director for the Center for Auto Safety and says that "" Ford owners continue to file complaints with NHTSA about exposure to exhaust and carbon monoxide in their Explorers. Scores of consumers, even after receiving their “peace of mind” fix, continue to report experiencing the same symptoms as before their visit to the Ford dealership.""

# Silver Linings

According to Hyatt (2019), ""the good news, if there is any in all this, is that Ford is introducing an all-new Explorer for the 2020 model year, and the powertrain and exhaust setup are not being carried over wholesale."" Even still, this is a company that is actively choosing to ignore a problem it discovered in 2011 and not do a recall. I know that I will never trust Ford again, and I am trading it in (with full disclosure to the dealer) tomorrow.

*Caveat: While some reports have said this resolved the issue (Beene, 2019), further reading states that complaints persist (Hyatt, 2019). The free fix program concluded on 31 December 2018*

YouShouldKnow,diefrv,"YSK how Germany teaches WWII, in school","As a German having lived in more countries then most, I've been asked this question by a lot of people a little awkwardly all the time. 

Now, the 2nd World war won't be officially discussed until roughly the 10th year.
But since it's such a big part of the history most kindergartners are aware of the Nazis to varying degrees. 

As an example, I remember being on the play ground with a good friend and he told me that he knows the Nazi symbol which I didn't believe that they had a symbol but he drew it in the dirt and erased it instantly. Because we both knew that these were terrible people, and we shouldn't get caught drawing that. I know for a fact this was before 1st grade. Since I knew the symbol by then already. 

Then throughout school you will find German kids who know somethings but as I said it wasn't taught officially until year 10. So I remember some teachers, like one time our principal in 3rd or 4th grade, will take it upon themselves to talk a little about it. 


Ergos when 10th grade finally rolls around and you're still in school (cause some graduate at grade 9) you will already a great deal, I would dare to say more then most other countries children, generally speaking. 

Now we do not! Ever teach Hitler as some sort of hero at all. I remember a girl said well you can say what you will but there was order in Germany, or another common one is he did so much bad but he did build the Autobahn (Germany's interstate/motorway system, and yes there is no speed limit) 
The teacher quickly replied how dangerous it is to glorify some aspects of Hitler due to the many horrible things that he caused. Cause you see it was way more then just the extermination of 6mio Jews. 

We then talk about WWII for the entirety of year 10 we talk about all the horrible past we share. A lot of teachers when I grew up would say that we have inherited guilt. If that doesn't make sense think of America and the slaves. Because the system built upon crime and awfulness is still affecting the modern day, even though it happened long ago. I don't think that is taught anymore though. But still is an interesting talking point. (And if you'd like to comment I'd be more then curious, do you think that the ancestors of a Nation can bestow guilt upon the following generations) 

Most, if not all, schools will attend a trip to a memorial site or a concentration camp even (since they're all in the east and Poland it's not many that go) before going most teachers will make absolutely clear how reverent the student body needs to be since this is a memorial site to the victims of WWII.

Example: Imagine you're running forward and are forced to run backward suddenly, this would strain your legs a lot, and possibly damage/break them. But if you're allowed to slow down and stop completely, *then* run backwards, it would not strain your legs nearly as much to perform that task, and you wouldn't break your legs. While not a perfect analogy, this explains well enough what your transmission goes through when switching to or from reverse while still moving.",1570831166,"Coming to a complete stop before going from reverse to drive greatly increases the life of your vehicle's transmission.

YouShouldKnow,detamc,YSK how to make sense of cold medicines.,"It’s getting to be that time of year again, when you get all sniffly and snotty and have to lug yourself over to the drugstore to try to find something to make you less miserable, only to be faced with something like [this.](https://imgur.com/MDcXoXc)   
I once spent half an hour on the phone with someone trying to explain to them which medicines they should pick up based on their symptoms, so I figured this was something that could be useful to a fair number of people.

Here’s the main takeaway: cold medicines are branded in a ton of different ways, and usually contain multiple active ingredients that fall into just a few distinct categories. Disregard all the marketing stuff and pay attention to what’s actually in it, then correlate those to your symptoms. I tried to give plenty of detail but there's a TL;DR at the bottom!

**Decongestants** [(obligatory citation)](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/decongestants)  
Use these if you have sinus pressure or stuffiness. They constrict the blood vessels in your nasal passages to reduce the swelling. As such, they should NOT be used by people who have high blood pressure – these people should look for brands with “HBP” at the end, as these are decongestant-free. They are also pretty activating, so can cause sleep problems if you take them at night.  
Names:  
Phenylephrine – these are the ones with “PE” at the end of the name, which have now taken over after pseudoephedrine (see below) became behind-the-counter only in most states.  
Pseudoephedrine – if you find that this works better (I do), you can ask for it behind the counter, just don't use it to make meth.

**Antihistamines** [(obligatory citation)](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies)  
These drugs simply block histamines – the substances that give you a runny, sniffly nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes. All will make you drowsy, so are not ideal during the day but great at night. The presence of antihistamines is actually the main difference between “daytime” and “nighttime” formulas of cold medicines.  
Names:  
Diphenhydramine  
Doxylamine  
Chlorpheniramine  
Cetirizine  
Loratadine

**Mucolytic/expectorant** [(obligatory citation)](https://www.rxlist.com/consumer_guaifenesin_mucinex/drugs-condition.htm)  
This drug loosens mucus, helping you cough up the junk that feels like it’s stuck in your chest.  
Name: Guaifenesin

**Cough suppressants** [(obligatory citation)](https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/antitussives.html)  
These also help with cough, but at the level of the brain, by actually suppressing your cough reflex. This is also the main category for which prescription medicines also exist, if you find that the over-the-counter ones aren’t doing enough. But keep in mind that if you're coughing up a lot of junk, suppressing your cough will just keep all the junk in there, so try to only use these when your cough is really bothersome, like at night.  
Names:  
Dextromethorphan (look for “DM” at the end of the name)  
Codeine (prescription-only)  
Benzonatate (prescription-only)

**Pain/fever relievers** [(obligatory citation)](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/pain-relievers)  
Help with that generalized achy, crappy feeling of having a cold, as well as reduce fever and target specific pain (e.g. sore throat, sinus headache). One of these is found in a ton of combination cold medicines, but a lot of people already have these at home, so make sure you’re not unintentionally doubling up.  
Names:  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol   
Ibuprofen (should not be used by people with kidney issues or GI bleeds)  
Naproxen (same warnings as above) 


**TL;DR  
Sinus pressure and stuffiness: phenylephrine (“PE”), pseudoephedrine (behind pharmacy counters only)  
Sneezing and sniffling: diphenhydramine, doxylamine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine (all will make you drowsy)

First off; Internet only promotions DO exist. Never believe the lie that there isn't one, there is. Honestly, you should sign up for internet online in general, you'll see the promotions and put two and two together that internet alone is cheaper.

Second, there is no tax, fcc, sports, or other fees on internet that there is on cable. In some states, the cable fees can amount to 15-20$ MORE than the advertised package - that's never the case for the internet.

WIth internet, you can get your own modem and router, you can not do that with cable - you'll always be paying more for equipment on cable only!

Promotions advertised and sold never take into account equipment, taxes, or fees, which there is significantly more of on cable than internet (usually internet has no fees what so ever in most states)

Promotions that happen to make the cable and internet bundle cheaper even with equipment, taxes, and fees ignored are never permanent, and internet only promotions do exist. If your bundle for 2 years cable internet is cheaper, and your plan to cancel and resign up for a new deal is a choice - guess what, you can cancel and resign up for that internet promotion too.

Second, there is no tax, fcc, sports, or other fees on internet that there is on cable. In some states, the cable fees can amount to 15-20$ MORE than the advertised package - that's never the case for the internet.

WIth internet, you can get your own modem and router, you can not do that with cable - you'll always be paying more for equipment on cable only!

Promotions advertised and sold never take into account equipment, taxes, or fees, which there is significantly more of on cable than internet (usually internet has no fees what so ever in most states)

Promotions that happen to make the cable and internet bundle cheaper even with equipment, taxes, and fees ignored are never permanent, and internet only promotions do exist. If your bundle for 2 years cable internet is cheaper, and your plan to cancel and resign up for a new deal is a choice - guess what, you can cancel and resign up for that internet promotion too.

That's all! Hope it helps!"

YouShouldKnow,d679zm,YSK: Saying ‘Hello’ could save someone’s life.,"Bit of a personal story...

In high school I attempted suicide twice. I failed the first time because I wasn’t particularly serious, the second time because I was interrupted.

I’ve always been a lonely person. Even in a room full of people I would feel totally isolated. I would go days without really talking to anyone, and the isolation would send me sinking into pits of insignificance and depression.

Two years ago I had another season mental heath relapse. I felt lonely, isolated, and after a few months I decided to try to take my own life again.

I was in a grocery store basically preparing for my “last meal”, and a stranger walked up to me— a guy in his late 30’s early 40’s (I was in my early 20’s).

“Hello! Is your day going alright?”

I didn’t know how to respond. He seemed so genuine and caring I broke down. I told him my plans and he sat with me while I cried in the isle. After talking for a little bit I called my parents to come get me and wound up moving back home for a time so I could be safe.

A few years later and I’m still here, still struggle with loneliness, but after some professional treatment I think I could say I’m happy.

That man never even told me his name, but his “Hello” pulled me out of the background of reality to the forefront of what it means to be human— to matter. It seems so silly, but when he acknowledged that I existed he saved my life.

- Volunteering some time with an organization you aren't familiar with is a GREAT way to begin.  Ask around or start looking on search engines and social media.

If you have a communal recreation center or university/college in your town, those are also great ways to begin connecting with new people and opportunities.

- Speaking of targeted ads, search (whatever hobby/sport/field you're interested in) and then the word jobs.   It doesn't have to be in your area, but it could get you started in the right direction to finding related positions, which you can then google for further detail.  Ads may also start appearing for that line of work in or near your area, if work is available.

- Look for weekend or weeklong courses in your area.  Sign up for one, and ask the other participants what they do for a living and why they're taking the course.  First aid is a great start if you don't have it, as many different jobs require it, but literally anything is useful to some degree.  Pick whatever interests you.  Or, if you can and want to, check out full courses at a university or college.

- Look up courses in a university website.  Read their descriptions.  Search jobs that need xxxx for whatever catches your attention.  Follow the rabbit trails.

- Look in your local classified ads for temporary or weekend type jobs that can give you a taste in something new without a huge time commitment (if you don't have time to give - if you do, longer term temporary or seasonal jobs are fantastic for trialing new fields of work or study!)

- Search temporary or seasonal jobs in your area, for the reasons mentioned above.

- Look beyond the classified ads.  Every city and government have their own Careers page.  Look on university websites, many have job pages specifically for students who need summer jobs etc.  Check out the websites of your favorite companies to shop at.  Check out the websites of companies in that field you've always thought it would be cool to work in.  

- Look into volunteering internationally if you are able.  Different organizations around the world offer all kinds of cool knowledge and practice for skills you might never have an opportunity to use at home.

YouShouldKnow,cxi422,YSK: The reason your phone's battery capacity sucks is because you wait until it hits 5% to charge it.,"Deep discharging lithium ion batteries puts stress on the battery. Regular deep discharges will predictably and dramatically decrease battery capacity.

If you only learn one thing from this post, let it be this: 

**When the window pops up at 20% telling you to charge your phone, you need to charge your phone NOW.**

Charging to 100% and holding for a long time (say overnight) also stresses lithium ion batteries. (Though anecdotally I suspect phone makers have figured out how to minimize the impact of holding at 100%, by cycling the battery after it's left plugged in at 100% for x amount of time).  

**To maximize battery life**: Batteries are at their lowest stress level when held around 50% and recharged after 10% of discharge. So the absolute best way to maximize battery life is to charge to 55%, and then discharge to 45%, and repeat throughout the day. Of course, this isn't realistic for most users.

**A real life battery strategy**: Charge to 90%, run down to 50%, and then recharge.

**Real, real life strategy**: Some days you're going to need more capacity between charges. On those days, top up your battery from 90% to 100% right before heading out. Turn on battery saver mode at 40%-30%. If at all possible, plug it in before it hits 20%. Running the battery down a few times won't cause a noticeable decrease in capacity. 

Myth: *You need to regularly run your phone down to 0% and charge back up to 100% to avoid losing capacity.* This was true for Ni-Cad batteries. Doing this is bad for Li-ion batteries.  

Myth: *You need to run your Li-ion batteries down to 0% and charge back up to 100% every month/3 months to calibrate the battery.* This process will calibrate the battery, but you only need to calibrate the battery when it NEEDS calibrating. If the battery indicator is doing wonky stuff like suddenly dropping from 50% to 38%, that's a sign that it needs calibrating.

YouShouldKnow,cxdbue,YSK what to do if you think you are being followed,"I never thought it could happen to me, but it did. 

I was coming home from work and merged into a busy lane. The driver behind gave me plenty of space to maneuver and I gave him a courtesy hand wave after I merged. From that point on, he began following me. This driver mimic my lane changes and took all my exact turns. Even as I entered a residential area, he still continued to maintain a two car length distance. I tried making eye contact with him to see if he was road-raging, but he was wearing sunglasses - in the evening. My mind started to race, I was getting closer to my home, I wasn't thinking straight... and I made a huge mistake. 

# So, YSK what to do if you are being followed...

TL;DR - DO NOT GO HOME IF YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED - even if you think you are. Instead, continue driving and call the police immediately. Try to gather as much description as possible and do not attempt to confront the other person.

Here is a little guide which goes into further detail about being followed: 

**Why would someone follow you?** 

&gt;Don't bother trying to understand the other person's reasoning. They could be a Private Investigator, a kidnapper, a family or a best friend's crazy ex. -you just don't know. In the here and now, assume they are going to do you harm. 

**How do you know if someone is following you?**

&gt;You should maintain situational awareness of your surroundings at all time. Whether it is something monotonous like daily driving to and from work or loading groceries in your car at a parking lot, always pay attention to your environment and keep an eye out on anomalies (like being followed by the same person for 20m). And don't forget to listen to your gut! A simple intuitive feeling can be an ounce of prevention that is worth a pound of cure.   
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the Moscow Rules which I found helpful distinguishing between someone following me by accident vs. someone with deliberate intentions.   
&gt;  
&gt; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Moscow\_rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moscow_rules)  

1. One time = an accident
2. Two times = a coincidence
3. Three times = enemy action

**Are you being paranoid?**

&gt;You can try to take the following actions if you want to be 100% sure you are being followed:

* Light up your turn signal and see if they do it too. But do not take your required turn and keep driving straight. Did they go straight to? 
* Continue driving around in a circle. Most people don't drive around in circles. Are they still behind you? 
* Make a safe maneuver which you normally would not take, like a U turn or drive in/out of a fast food parking lot. Are they still behind you? 
* Go onto a freeway and immediately get off. Did they do the same?

**Someone is following me...now what?**

&gt;Again, do not go home if you suspect you are being followed. Gather as much information as possible *as you call the police*: license plate, vehicle make, vehicle color, sex, race, hair and eye color, build, age, distinguished markings on the car, etc. 

* Here is a link to UC Berkeley Police Department which breaks down a description of a suspect:  [https://ucpd.berkeley.edu/campus-safety/report-crime/describe-suspect](https://ucpd.berkeley.edu/campus-safety/report-crime/describe-suspect) 
* Here is a link to UC Berkeley Police Department which breaks down a description of a suspect vehicle: [https://ucpd.berkeley.edu/describe-suspect-vehicle](https://ucpd.berkeley.edu/describe-suspect-vehicle) 

&gt;Do not attempt to stop the vehicle or attempt to leave the vehicle. You are much safer inside the car than on the outside. And do NOT attempt to confront the other person. You should drive yourself to a police station or a fire department.  If those you do not know these locations, continue driving in a well-lit/public area until the police operator gives you further instructions.   
&gt;  
&gt;If the person behind you starts to get aggressive, you may have to use Startrek + 2F2F maneuvers. And if necessary, use evasive maneuvers to distance yourself from the potential threat; i.e. they get out of their car and begin to approach your vehicle at a stop sign/red light.  

Remember, like the rules of boxing, ""defend yourself at all times."" You should be vigilant, calm, and stay in control of your thoughts. Do not panic if you are being followed. And do not think it could never happen to you!

For those wondering about my mistake...^(I accidentally went straight home). I was so confused (and a little pissed) to why this person was following me that I parked my car and ^(got out of my vehicle to confront the driver). Luckily (?) the driver never turned into my parking lot. Instead, he took the only exit which led him into the opposite direction of the main road he followed me on. I filed a report and nothing has happened to me or my car since.",1567148110,"what to do if you think you are being followed I never thought it could happen to me, but it did.

From that point on, he began following me. This driver mimic my lane changes and took all my exact turns. Even as I entered a residential area, he still continued to maintain a two car length distance. I tried making eye contact with him to see if he was road-raging, but he was wearing sunglasses - in the evening. My mind started to race, I was getting closer to my home, I wasn't thinking straight... and I made a huge mistake. 

# So,  what to do if you are being followed...

TL;DR - DO NOT GO HOME IF YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED - even if you think you are. Instead, continue driving and call the police immediately. Try to gather as much description as possible and do not attempt to confront the other person.

Here is a little guide which goes into further detail about being followed: 

**Why would someone follow you?** 

&gt;Don't bother trying to understand the other person's reasoning. They could be a Private Investigator, a kidnapper, a family or a best friend's crazy ex. -you just don't know. In the here and now, assume they are going to do you harm. 

**How do you know if someone is following you?**

&gt;You should maintain situational awareness of your surroundings at all time. Whether it is something monotonous like daily driving to and from work or loading groceries in your car at a parking lot, always pay attention to your environment and keep an eye out on anomalies (like being followed by the same person for 20m). And don't forget to listen to your gut! A simple intuitive feeling can be an ounce of prevention that is worth a pound of cure.   
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the Moscow Rules which I found helpful distinguishing between someone following me by accident vs. someone with deliberate intentions.   
&gt;  
&gt; [\_Moscow\_rules](  

1. One time = an accident
2. Two times = a coincidence
3. Three times = enemy action

**Are you being paranoid?**

&gt;You can try to take the following actions if you want to be 100% sure you are being followed:

* Light up your turn signal and see if they do it too. But do not take your required turn and keep driving straight. Did they go straight to? 
* Continue driving around in a circle. Most people don't drive around in circles. Are they still behind you? 
* Make a safe maneuver which you normally would not take, like a U turn or drive in/out of a fast food parking lot. Are they still behind you? 
* Go onto a freeway and immediately get off. Did they do the same?

**Someone is following me...now what?**

&gt;Again, do not go home if you suspect you are being followed. Gather as much information as possible *as you call the police*: license plate, vehicle make, vehicle color, sex, race, hair and eye color, build, age, distinguished markings on the car, etc. 

* Here is a link to UC Berkeley Police Department which breaks down a description of a suspect:  []( 
* Here is a link to UC Berkeley Police Department which breaks down a description of a suspect vehicle: []( 

&gt;Do not attempt to stop the vehicle or attempt to leave the vehicle. You are much safer inside the car than on the outside. And do NOT attempt to confront the other person. You should drive yourself to a police station or a fire department.  If those you do not know these locations, continue driving in a well-lit/public area until the police operator gives you further instructions.   
&gt;  
&gt;If the person behind you starts to get aggressive, you may have to use Startrek + 2F2F maneuvers. And if necessary, use evasive maneuvers to distance yourself from the potential threat; i.e. they get out of their car and begin to approach your vehicle at a stop sign/red light.  

Remember, like the rules of boxing, ""defend yourself at all times."" You should be vigilant, calm, and stay in control of your thoughts. Do not panic if you are being followed. And do not think it could never happen to you!

For those wondering about my mistake...^(I accidentally went straight home). I was so confused (and a little pissed) to why this person was following me that I parked my car and ^(got out of my vehicle to confront the driver). Luckily (?) the driver never turned into my parking lot. Instead, he took the only exit which led him into the opposite direction of the main road he followed me on. I filed a report and nothing has happened to me or my car since."

YouShouldKnow,cw2bo0,YSK You can negotiate your interest rate and warranty when purchasing a car at a dealer. (And a bunch of other good tips that came to mind as I was typing this post.),"I sold cars for a couple years in 2015 after I got out of the military and this is what I learned. 

Most people only think to, or only know to focus on price when negotiating but the dealer is legally allowed to jack your interest rate up 1.5%. This is an incentive for the dealer to increase your rate for the bank as the bank will give the dealer a kickback for the extra rate hike. More often than not it is best to get pre-approved from your preferred bank or credit union beforehand (bring it printed with you or available on your phone, make sure it is official and not generic, credit ran, the whole nine) but still see if the dealer can beat it as they still get incentives from the bank (without screwing you on the rate) that the finance manager sets you up with. Might save a little bit on your rate having them try to beat it. 

You can run your credit multiple times when looking into getting pre-approved for a car loan (mortgage too) within 30 days from the first credit pull and it will count as one hard inquiry. They changed this as it prevented people from getting a second opinion due to not wanting the hit on their credit report for multiple checks. So don't be afraid to tell the salesman/finance manager you are walkin' if you don't get the deal you want. (Unless you love the car and don't think you can find that opportunity easily somewhere else, then I wouldn't haggle unreasonably.) 

Also, I've found most people, once they go to sign after negotiating the terms for the purchase, assume the negotiating or the ""hard part"" is over. The warranty and other add-ons are negotiable, this is how the finance manager makes their commission. Any amount they sell the warranty or add ons (clear coat, seat protectant, car accessories) above the amount they can't go below is their commission. Hold firm and don't be an asshole and most times you can get away with a great deal on what they sell when signing. 

When negotiating price don't be a jerk and hold firm, within reason of course, they're not going to give it away. The best tactic after trying to wear them down is saying you will walk away, politely of course, if you're an ass they just won't care to deal with you. If you have you're pre approval already you've got nothing to lose but time, unless you love the car and dont think you can find elsewhere as I mentioned before. 

A lot of times if there is a dealership within reasonable driving distance that has a similar vehicle with a lower price (same year model, mileage, trim, condition or as close to it as possible) they will match it if there is enough profit in the car. If there are bigger cities near you they usually have better deals so search around before you go local to hopefully price match and save you the trip. Also it's good to keep the money in your local economy so win-win. 

New vehicles do not have as much profit for the dealer to negotiate as you may think. Maybe $2500-$3500 on average for Chevy, Toyota, Honda etc. Luxury cars there is more, Mercedes and BMW often had $7000+ when I was selling cars in 2015. (All of this info is based on when i was selling in 2015 so sorry if things have changed, please double check everything I've mentioned to be safe.) 

Dealers will often sell new vehicles later in the year a few hundred dollars under what they paid or at exactly what they paid (they call that figure ""at invoice"") because they mostly care about the units sold when it comes to new vehicles. That's how the manufacturer determines how many units they will provide that dealer based on how many vehicles they sell year over year (maybe month over month?) Also, the more new inventory they sell the more money they get from the manufacturer for the dealership.

On new vehicles the customer satisfaction survey the manufacturer sends the customer after a new purchase means EVERYTHING to the dealer so hang that over their head when negotiating. ""I'm only giving you a perfect score on the survey if I get the deal I'm looking for."" (Anything less than perfect on the survey is considered a fail so it holds a lot of weight for that perfect score.) Sometimes those assholes will put in a fake email for the survey if they feel the customer won't give perfect scores so tell them you'll be contacting the manufacturer to make sure you get your survey. 

For certain brands, Costco members get amazing deals on new cars with no haggling. Always within a few hundred dollars above or below what the dealer paid (we hated costco deals, low commission lol) go to Costco customer service to set this up (maybe online too?) 

Certified pre-owned purchases are great, they have low miles, a very thorough inspection/repair and a real beefy warranty.

The best time to get a good deal on a new vehicle is when they don't have many of the previous year model at the dealership as the current year models are coming in. (Buying a 2019 vehicle when there are a few left om the lot and they have mostly 2020's.) They really want to get rid of those to make room for the new one's with more profit. And as I said they are looking to just move the units, especially on the previous year models. 

We sold 90% of new Subaru's under what the dealer paid no matter what time of year. For some reason they gave those things away (figuratively) I'm not sure why to be honest but we always did that, it was an easy sale. They are amazing cars by the way. Unique engines, one of the safest cars, low maintenance (except for timing chain at around 120k miles deoending on the model and it's expensive, not covered under warranty) and about the best AWD in that category or ""caliber"" of vehicle.  

If the dealer is selling a used car that they took on trade that is your best chance to get a great deal as there is the most profit in those out of other used cars they bought from an auction, rental company, other dealer etc. ALWAYS SELL YOUR OWN USED CAR PRIVATE PARTY!!!! (On your own) They will offer a disgustingly low amount because you're excited about the new car you're buying and you just want to get in it that day or they know people are lazy/don't have time. If you don't need to sell your car to use for your down payment on the new one dont even bother bringing it in. Unless you dont feel comfortable selling on your own or have the time etc. then just bite the bullet and sell armor the dealeror pay a friend to sell it for you. 

When checking the carfax, if the dealer bought a car from cold weather areas with icy roads that they put salt down, check the bottom of the car for metal corrosion. That can be a deal breaker. 

Always, always, always take a used car you're going to purchase to have a mechanic look it over. Best money you can spend if you're serious about buying it. Even if it doesnt check out and you're out the $125 or whatever it is, it sure beats hundreds or maybe even thousands if it's items needing repair down the road (pun intended)  that the warranty won't cover. 

Make sure they give you a full tank of gas when buying a used car. 

If you're buying a new car and know exactly what you want and dont need a test drive or already have driven it (please drive before buying if you haven't though, make sure it's comfortable, drives smooth, good visibility etc.) you can call the dealer and negotiate over the phone and have them deliver it to your doorstep. Remember, you're in charge not them, be bold, be nice about it, stay firm and get your way. This can save you hours. They will bring all of the paperwork to you when delivering the car. You can do this with used cars but too risky.

Be leery of buying a car that was previously a rental on the carfax. Those are notorious for problems due to people driving them recklessly since it's just for a couple days and it's not there's. Some people drive rental cars very hard and get squirrelly. 

One of the best ways to buy a used car is buy it outside of a dealer (private party) have a mechanic inspect it!!!!!! And check kelly blue book price online. Then, depending on the mileage (they wknt sell a warranty over a certain amount of miles)  buy a warranty from a dealer.

&gt;1) Recognize and accept that you're feeling anxious.

&gt;2) Once you're feeling anxious, immediately Involve yourself in your surroundings. Look around, pay attention to what's going on around you. Notice who's there, what people are saying, what the environment looks like.

&gt;3) Then I'd like you to Distract yourself. Talk to someone and really pay attention to the conversation, sing a song, read a magazine, or watch television. Try to become active in what you do, in other words, if you read a magazine, say the words aloud to yourself. The goal is to focus on something other than the panicky feelings you're experiencing.

&gt;4) When you are able to distract yourself away from your feelings, the panic will End by itself, without a struggle.

&gt;These steps are something you are going to have to practice, get used to and comfortable with. Please be patient with yourself. The technique probably will not come easily to you and will take some time to learn. If you have a long history of having panic attacks and have them frequently, you may want to consult with a mental health professional as you try this new approach.",1566713796,"The R.I.D.E. Method.

YouShouldKnow,cutz9a,"YSK if you must break your car window quickly, the windshield is the cheapest to replace.","Never thought this would happen, but as I exited my vehicle and opened the back door to get my children, the car locked itself. This has never happened in the 4 years that I've been the sole owner (bought new). I didn't have time to ponder why, or if I accidentally bumped the lock-all switch. 

My children are 1 &amp; 3 years old and still in car seats, so they were unable to extract themselves to unlock the vehicle. It wasn't sunny yet, but I did not have time to waste waiting for Geico or emergency responders. By sheer luck, a fellow parked next to me used to work at an auto body shop and said the windshield is the least expensive to replace compared to side windows ($99 to $300 without insurance; side windows are $200-500 plus more labor to disassemble and reassemble your door). 

Just finished the claim with Geico. No cost to me. 

The windshield is also safer to break; there's a plastic liner holding it all together, limiting the glass flying inward. _However_, it took a little more wrangling to reach the lock switch over the dashboard. If this had been an accident and there's a risk of explosion with children or pets inside, breaking the window closest to them is faster.

They should also be coached on what to do if they are to fall over; not necessarily private swimming lessons (although that is a great idea) but the parent(s) need(s) to spend time with their child(ren) and teach them how to learn the tool they are wearing, because that's what it is. 

This is inspired by the cute af kid trying to eat a banana while wearing wings, with a pool in the background. And for all those parents who say ""But I'm right there, I'll never let them out of my sight!"" I really don't care. Put them in proper goddamn PFD.

Ranging from murdering my family, to self harm, to body dysmorphia, to inappropriate sexual thoughts towards peers and children; my own thoughts were like a nightmare. The commonality among them all was that I DID NOT WANT to act on any of them, and felt horrified by the (non audible) voices in my head. 

Finally in college, at the peak of this terror, I told my mom. That I was worried that I was going to hurt someone, even her. That I hid all scissors in my dorm to protect my roommates. That i couldn't even walk past a knife without visualizing violence. That I was a happy and loving person, so why did my thoughts feel so evil?

My mom shared with me that when she was 20 she had a nearly identical experience, even going so far as going to a mental hospital to check herself in, in fear of what she would do to others. Her doctor quickly reassured her, as she did to me, that this was a form of OCD named ""Pure O."" It is also referred to as ""Intrusive Thoughts.""

How are these thoughts different than a passing bad thought? Say I am driving and I see a pedestrian, sometimes regular humans will think ""oh no what if i hit them"" and move on. For me, it is/was moreso, ""Oh no what if I hit them"" followed by ""why would i think such a terrible thing? what is wrong with me? What if I lose control and DO? what if i secretly DO want to hurt someone?"" And then obsess upon that thought until the next nightmare came along.

With all the recent violence, my intrusive thoughts have increased, and I know I'm not alone. I come from a family that participated in a bio study at Yale to identify the gene that causes this. On my maternal side of the family, 12 aunts/uncles, 20 cousins, and both my sisters suffer from this same thought disorder. All of us have donated blood to Yale for this purpose. 

 To my vague scientific understanding, this arises in individuals who may be highly compassionate and have an over-active amygdala. When a ""passing intrusive thought"" wizzes by in the mind of someone with a heightened amygdala, we respond to the thought as a threat; therefore, when it passes by our head again, we feel threatened and the frequency increases because we are scanning for any incoming danger (ie, will this thought return?).

I have been very fortunate to grow up in a family where this is common, and we all receive treatment via therapy, medication or both.

I'm sharing this because i want to spread the word and let anyone out there who fears their thoughts to know, you are not alone, you are safe, and by sharing these often shameful thoughts with a healthcare provider or trusted friend, you can receive the treatment you need.

YouShouldKnow,cn7o48,YSK How to Escape Sleep Paralysis,"(First two paragraphs are just explaining sleep paralysis)

For those of you who didn't know, when we fall asleep our bodies release a chemical into our blood that essentially freezes your muscles. This is done to keep us from acting out our dreams and injuring ourselves. (Sleepwalkers' bodies don't release enough of this chemical, hence the walking).

If you wake up during sleep paralysis there is a period in which you are literally paralyzed until your body realizes that you are awake. Additionally if you are a lucid dreamer you will often be aware of your paralysis while sleeping. Needless to say, sleep paralysis is terrifying, like claustrophobia to the nth degree.

To escape it, all you must do is focus on a small muscle like a single finger. The chemical mainly focuses on large muscles so your fingers are able to twitch. As soon as you move them chemical moves away from the area, so just twitch your fingers until it is no longer difficult and then move on to a hand. When your hand is moving freely, try your arm. Bit by bit you can slowly escape paralysis until you are fully mobile again. This method works very well for me and i have never been stuck in paralysis for long because of it. One final note: whatever you do, do NOT struggle while in paralysis. It can really freak you out and even put you into shock, which can be fatal. Stay calm, and focus on moving your fingers.

YouShouldKnow,cn2brl,YSK Why your textbooks are expensive (and why your teacher just moved to a new edition),"I worked for the company that ran your school bookstore (k-12 through University).  Now that we're approaching Back 2 School time, there will be numerous posts complaining about your school bookstore.  And while it does indeed suck, the real reasons why teachers use new editions aren't brought up as often.

So here's what's actually happening, so you can be better informed in your complaining.


**Price is mostly determined by the publisher.**  The bookstore buys the book (when new) from the publisher.  As publishers don't make money on used books, they often price them rather high to get their money while they can. (more on this later)

**Most of the time, your teacher would rather just stick with an old edition.**  They already know the text, have built their lesson plan around it, and in many cases have some extra copies.

BUT

**If your bookstore can't be reasonably sure they can get enough copies of an older edition, they will most likely tell the teacher they need to move to a newer edition.**  Publisher's don't print old editions of textbooks, so nearly all your bookstore's inventory of an older edition is sourced from buybacks.  As you can imagine, there is less available inventory for an older edition as time goes on.  If the bookstore can only stock 12 copies of the book, and there are 40 kids in the class, that's a problem.


which also means that

**The bookstore will only buy back your book if they are reasonably sure it will be used again next year.**  You're not renting the book, you're buying it.  And the bookstore has no reason to buy it back from you unless they know they can sell it again next year.  I know this part sucks, but you can't really blame them for this. 


also


**The publisher (in most cases) get's no money from old editions.**  So as you can imagine, they do everything in their power to try and push new editions as often as possible.  This is why they love ebooks and online modules.


**TLDR**

It's a mix of diminishing availability and publishers trying to maintain sales.

If the bookstore can only stock 12 copies of the book, and there are 40 kids in the class, that's a problem.


which also means that

**The bookstore will only buy back your book if they are reasonably sure it will be used again next year.**  You're not renting the book, you're buying it.  And the bookstore has no reason to buy it back from you unless they know they can sell it again next year.  I know this part sucks, but you can't really blame them for this. 


also


**The publisher (in most cases) get's no money from old editions.**  So as you can imagine, they do everything in their power to try and push new editions as often as possible.  This is why they love ebooks and online modules.


**TLDR**

It's a mix of diminishing availability and publishers trying to maintain sales.  Your teacher and school are often not actively deciding to move to a new edition."

Here is a picture of the plant in it's more common purple variety :https://imgur.com/gallery/QtpfjGF and here is a pic of it as it's more natural green variety of which it normally goes back to once in the wild  https://imgur.com/a/bkyLGnv so I'm sure many of you have seen this plant and some of you even have this plant in your lawn.

Well you should know this species of plant is helping to spread Lyme's disease as it's leaves make a perfect microenvironment for black leg ticks(ones that transmit Lyme's) to develop. The leaves make it very humid which is something the ticks love and because of this the young are able grow in a safe environment. Additionally the thorns and thickness if this plant can protect the ticks from predators such as opossums and turkeys.  The bush can also offer refuge for white footed mice which are the main reservoir for Lyme's(much more important than deer or anything else)https://tickencounter.org/prevention/mouse_targeted_devices. The reason mice are important is the young ticks will normally feed in small animals like the mice for their first stage. That's where they pick up the Lyme's. After that they will bite others hosts and that's how they can spread it. 

Another reason to not buy this terrible plant is that it's a weed of a plant. If you go to a wild area where this has taken root, the bushes are everywhere. They grow to very large sizes and are extremely hard to remove. I've removed a lot of them myself and to make sure the plant doesn't just come back next year you have to remove every root and then make sure all the braches and such are off the ground because it will reroot from a branch. The plant takes a lot of effort to get ride of. Now this is important because many if not all states have an invasive species control group of some sort. Some are funded through the government and other are volunteering. These people face a huge work load they are almost always very under funded undermanned and trying their best to just prevent spread.  So this bush is bad because it's takes a lot of resources, because it's time consuming to remove and it has to be checked back on the following year to make sure it was done properly. 

So if you are a lawn owner I plead you to look up you local states ""do not plant list""  help out your local invasive species removal group by just not making the problem any worse.  Also if you are willing please consider removing the plant from your yard(if present) and replacing it with a native plant. Most ""do not plant "" lists normally have a sister  please plant list so that should help you find information on responsible planting. 

For people who choose to remove please wear gloves. This plant has some nasty thorns that you won't feel at first but then the next day you will have some deep splinters that are painful and infected.

YouShouldKnow,ci5ch0,YSK what happens when you throw trash into a recycling bin.,"This article came out a couple months ago, and it's pretty accurate about what happens. 

As someone who works in this industry, recycling is our most hated line of business. Too many customers and businesses do not adhere to all the instructions given even when the container itself says right on it ""CARDBOARD ONLY"". My company gets charged over $2,000 a month for contaminated loads.

Recycling isn't all sunshine and rainbows many people think it to be. It's not as simple as the plastic getting melted down and reshaped, and not as simple as paper or cardboard getting ""reused"".

Many municipalities are jumping on the fad that is ""going green"", but in all honesty, recycle is anything but green.

&amp;#x200B;

***Here are some excerpts from the article:***

&gt;You might think you’re helping the environment when you start tossing everything into your recycling bin willy nilly, but you might be causing more harm than good. Take, for instance, an unwashed pasta sauce jar. It could potentially contaminate sought-after items, like paper and cardboard. Plastic shopping bags pose the biggest problem for recycling facilities, as the bags can wrap around machinery and could cost over $10,000 to replace

As someone who works in this industry, recycling is our most hated line of business. Too many customers and businesses do not adhere to all the instructions given even when the container itself says right on it ""CARDBOARD ONLY"". My company gets charged over $2k a month for contaminated loads.

Recycling isn't all sunshine and rainbows many people think it to be. It's not as simple as the plastic getting melted down and reshaped, and not as simple as paper or cardboard getting ""reused"".

Many municipalities are jumping on the fad that is ""going green"", but in all honesty, recycle is anything but green.

&amp;#x200B;

***Here are some excerpts from the article:***

&gt;You might think you’re helping the environment when you start tossing everything into your recycling bin willy nilly, but you might be causing more harm than good. Take, for instance, an unwashed pasta sauce jar. It could potentially contaminate sought-after items, like paper and cardboard. Plastic shopping bags pose the biggest problem for recycling facilities, as the bags can wrap around machinery and could cost over $10k to replace

An assault rifle is a fully automatic (fires bullets continuously when you hold down the trigger) rifle that fires an intermediate cartridge (less powerful than a full-powered rifle cartridge but more powerful than a common handgun cartridge).

**Assault Weapon**

The legal definition of ""assault weapon"" varies by region, but typically refers to a semi-automatic (fires one bullet per pull of the trigger) rifle or pistol that can accept a detachable magazine and has one or multiple arbitrary features from a list, such as: a vertical grip (rifle only), a vertical foregrip, an adjustable or folding stock, a flash suppressor, a threaded muzzle, a barrel shroud, or an attached flare launcher."
YouShouldKnow,cdmgt9,"YSK that in the US, if you are arrested and you choose to remain silent, you must ""unambiguously"" invoke this right before the police are required to stop questioning.","In [Berghuis v. Thompkins](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/560/370/), the US Supreme Court ruled that in order to invoke the ""right to cut off questioning"" from the police, you must ""unambiguously"" state that you are exercising your right to remain silent. Simply saying nothing is not considered enough to invoke this right. 

The decision states:

&gt;    In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the Miranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda rights, waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning. Understanding his rights in full, he waived his right to remain silent by making a voluntary statement to the police. The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins’s right to remain silent before interrogating him.

Thompkins was accused (and ultimately found guilty) of murder. At an interrogation, he was practically silent until near the end, when an officer asked him, three questions: ""Do you believe in God?"",' ""Do you pray to God?"", and ""Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?"". His one-word response to the final question, ""Yes"", was considered an admission of guilt and used to convict him. He argued that he was coerced into making that statement and that it violated his 5th amendment right. 

My understanding is that although you *can* simply not say anything, the police can continue to question you until you say you will not answer any questions. Once you've been Mirandized, waiving your right to remain silent can be implied by making any response to a question. Further, police are not required to obtain a waiver that you know your rights and choose to waive them.

YouShouldKnow,cbd509,YSK how to recognize a urinary blockage in cats - it can be fatal and EVERY HOUR COUNTS!,"Having just gone through the shock, fear, guilt, and worry of finding out that my cat had a urinary blockage instead of some basic constipation, I felt compelled to share this knowledge. 


Firstly-my kitty is okay. He’s still recovering, but we did thankfully catch it in time. But we could have caught it 12 hours sooner (important hours) if we knew what we were looking at. 


**Why is a urinary blockage so serious?**

-It is what it sounds like-your cat can’t pee. This is particularly more common in male, neutered cats from 1-5, and elderly. This is serious because the bladder fills up, and can back up into the kidneys, causing kidney damage. This can happen in a matter of days. All the while, the kitty is in pain-think about how it feels when you really need to pee, but can’t find a bathroom yet. In the worst case scenario the kidney damage is so severe that the cat can actually pass away.


**What To Look Out For**

-You can google more extensive specifics, but what we saw was our cat going to the bathroom several times, but nothing happened. He was straining to go, but no pee (or poop) came out. He was not as interesting in his food. And he acted out of character - hiding under the couch and bed, which he doesn’t normally do. All of this occurred the day before we brought him into the vet. A day prior he was playing, and eating and purring like his usual self. **cats are very good at hiding pain and don’t usually show symptoms until it’s pretty serious**. This is the guilt I want to save you from. Yes, in hindsight I would have taken him to an ER straight away. I didn’t want to be the over dramatic google doctor cat mom, so instead we did an 8am at our usual vet (thinking he just needed a stool softener or something). *Do not hesitate to at least call about these symptoms*. 


**How Is The Blockage Treated (cost?)**

-I can only speak for our cat. But he had a severe blockage and needed to immediately be put under for a catheter. More severe cases may need surgery. He had fluids and a catheter for 3 days in the vet hospital because the urine had reached his kidneys. His urine was extremely bloody. It’s been 7 days and it’s now nearly yellow again. His kidney numbers thankfully bounced back to the normal range, but it was entirely possible that he would have had kidney disease as a result. He also needs to eat a special food now for urinary crystals/stones. 

-All in all this cost us ~$3000. Which brings me to a side point: get pet insurance while your animal is healthy. 


**Prevention?**

-I’m not a vet, so take this knowing that. But what is widely accepted is that moisture helps prevent this issue as it reduced the chances of urinary crystals. Cats don’t typically drink enough water because in the wild they would get it from eating their prey. So feeding wet food and always having fresh water (maybe a cat fountain) is a great way to encourage more drinking. 


Cats prefer a clean litter box, and moreso in a multi-cat household it is recommended to have 1 box per cat (at least). This reduces competition and stress for the box. Feline stress can cause quite a few issues in itself.

[Here is a great FAQ regarding service animal information by the ADA](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html)

First, let's define what the ADA considers a service animal: 
""A dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability."" 

The ADA only considers dogs and miniature horses (which won't be talked about here) as service animals. No cats or [peacocks](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/airplane-mode/emotional-support-peacock-denied-flight-united-airlines-n842971). But more importantly, the dog has to be trained to do work or perform a task. Performing a task or doing work can range from a variety of things, such as guiding a blind person, pulling a wheelchair, alerting during a seizure, or calming someone with PTSD during a panic attack. **Emotional support is NOT considered work or a performed task.** This is usually what someone with a fake service dog will claim is what their dog is for. It is important to know that emotional support animals are NOT covered by the ADA. Calming someone with PTSD and being emotional supportive are very different things.


# IDENTIFYING A FAKE SERVICE ANIMAL


While the ADA does NOT discriminate service dogs by breed, generally speaking, there are only a handful of breeds that will be used for real service animals. Labradors, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherds are going to be your most common breeds. I only point this out because if it is not one of these breeds, there is a very good chance it is a fake service dog. But do NOT call someone out on breed alone. 


A service animal is going to be very calm and very attentive to their handler. They won't be running around with joy, sniffing everything, barking randomly or other things you might expect a normal pet to be doing. They've got a job to do and they know it. It should be pretty rare you come across a real service dog.  If you are seeing them every day wherever you work or are, there is a very good chance they are fake. Obviously, you should never assume, but use some common sense. If you think you might have a fake service animal, then go from there.


Ok, so somebody has come into your establishment with their fake Pomeranian service dog and you would like to call them out. How should you go about this?


# CALLING OUT A FAKE SERVICE DOG


There are common misconceptions as far as what you can ask and do with service animals. Many people think that someone simply saying their dog is a service animal or their dog having a ""service animal"" patch on their harness makes their dog invincible to any rules but **this is simply not true.** 

First, there are **two** questions you are allowed to ask when somebody brings a service animal to your business.


1. Is the service animal required because of a disability?


2. What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?


Most people know they can ask the first question, which is just a yes/no question, so many people with fake service animals can answer with no issue. But the second question is a little trickier for someone to answer if they have a fake service animal. Remember, **you cannot ask WHY the person has a service dog, but you can ask WHAT the dog does.** There is a fine line between the two questions. The person's disability is private information, but the dog's job is not. It is as simple as that.


People with real disabilities requiring real service animals generally have some hostility towards other people exploiting the rights that they have with their service animal, **so someone with a real service dog is usually happy to answer the questions,** and it is well within your rights to ask, so don't be afraid to! 


The most common ""task"" that the owner of a fake service dog will claim is performed by their dog is ""emotional support."" As I said earlier in this post, **EMOTIONAL SUPPORT IS NOT A COVERED TASK FOR A SERVICE DOG.** If that is their answer, or some other variety of that, then they have no special right to be with their dog in a place they aren't typically allowed.


Once you have identified a fake service animal, they are no longer allowed any special treatment with their dog. You can ask the animal to leave your premises. The person WITHOUT the dog must still be allowed your services, but they now have no right to bring their fake service dog with them. The first time calling out and kicking out someone with a fake service dog, expect a little backlash. This person already has a sense of entitlement with being able to bring their dog wherever they feel like it, and have probably gotten away with it for awhile, but do not let that deter you from calling them out. This shit has gone on too long and there are REAL service animals that are affected by this nonsense.


# THINGS YOU CANNOT ASK FOR

The two questions that you are able to ask someone with a service animal are the main tools you have in identifying a fake service animal. But there are other things that people think you can ask, but you cannot. For example:

*Documentation/medical certificate
*Service Animal patch or vest
*Having the dog perform the task

Those generally are easy things to fake anyways, so don't get caught up demanding things that aren't required, as that can get you in trouble.


# OTHER WAYS TO KICK OUT A FAKE SERVICE DOG (or a real one)


As the ADA allows special treatment for service animals, it is expected that the service animal follows a set of ""rules"" if they're going to be given access to certain areas they aren't normally allowed. Not being able to follow these rules, they are grounds to have the animal removed, EVEN IF IT IS A REAL SERVICE DOG. It will be very rare that a real service animal cannot follow these rules, as they are very well trained, but a fake service dog might not be able to follow them, so use that to your advantage when calling out a fake service dog.


**Housebroken**


First and foremost, the dog must be housebroken. While most dogs are housebroken, bringing a dog to a new area can sometimes excite them and cause them to piss all over the place. If that's the case, you have every right to have them removed.


**Barking**


This one is slightly trickier. While simple barking does not allow for a dog to be removed as it can be something for a service dog to do for their handler, it definitely can be used depending on the environment. For example, if someone bring a service animal to a library and the dog begins to bark, they can be asked to leave. If they're at a concert hall and start to bark during the performance, they can be asked to leave. Again, most service dogs are not going to be barking for no reason at all like some pets will, so if that happens, if anything, use it as a method to possibly identify a fake service animal


**Altering the nature of the good, service or program**


What does it mean to alter the nature of the good, service or program? Basically, if you aren't able to provide your service because of the service dog, it can be removed. That doesn't mean just provide the service to the person WITH the service animal, BUT EVERYBODY ELSE TOO. If you cannot do your job because this dog is preventing you from doing so, they have no right to be in that specific area. A few examples (as provided by the ADA):

At the zoo, if your service animal is causing the other animals to become irate or generally anxious, they can be asked to leave that area. Of course, they still must be allowed in other areas where this is not a problem.

At a school, if there is a special section for kids with dog allergies, you cannot bring the service dog to that area. But again, they still must be allowed to use other areas of the school.



**Fake service animals aren't going away unless we all start calling them out on their bullshit.** Working with dogs, nothing irks me more than how terrible people can be with their dogs. Not using leashes, not picking up dog shit, feeding them too much, and of course FAKE SERVICE ANIMALS. I hate it all. I hope this post helps in fixing some of that. Please remember, do NOT be afraid to ask questions and do NOT be afraid of kicking out or denying access to someone with a FAKE SERVICE ANIMAL. Those with real service animals will thank you.",1562614690,"the rules and regulations regarding service animals and how to go about calling out a fake service animal # Disclaimer: this post is regarding federal ADA regulations regarding service animals.

YouShouldKnow,cab4lw,YSK an easy way to eliminate bad breath in a lot of cases,"The process takes minutes and usually lasts for a week per application. I’ve been doing it myself for years now. It has worked for a lot of people I know that have persisting bad breath.

You need two things:

**Hydrogen peroxide**, regular store concentration is best.

**Probiotic tablets**, I recommend going to Amazon and looking up tablets containing **BLIS M18**, which is a probiotic strain that actually **fights cavity causing bacteria itself.** Regular store probiotics will  remove odor however it makes more sense to populate your mouth with bacteria that actively assist your dental health. I use tablets with BLIS M18 to great effect.

Here’s the method:

1.	Floss/brush your teeth as normal.
2.	Use a mouthwash cap, cough syrup measuring cup, etc. Fill it halfway with hydrogen peroxide, other half with tap water.
3.	Swish and gargle the mixture.
4.	Rinse your mouth with tap water.
5.	Pop a probiotic tablet in your mouth and chew it up. Don’t swallow, just let it cover your whole mouth, your tongue, etc. We are trying to let the probiotic colonize.
6.	You can spit and rinse or just spit the rest out, up to you.

And that’s all.

Your breath after for the most part will be entirely odorless. Morning breath is almost eliminated. Even after a long day your breath stays odorless. The effects last about a week before you need to do the steps again.

The comments are always full of hateful comments about the ""lazy, idiot, bum"" mailperson, how disgusting they are for not caring about others property and how they should lose their jobs etc.

When in reality the onus is on you the buyer/receiver and the merchant/sender. Step outside of your own small world and think on it for a second, and you'll understand why. Your mailcarrier has 6-7 hours everyday to deliver thousands of pieces of mail, magazines, coupons, and hundreds of packages to literally hundreds of homes. They are on such a time constraint that if they spend more than a minute in the wrong spot according to their tracker then they will get investigated for it. Now imagine out of those hundreds of packages half of them say do not bend. There is literally no way in hell they can get out dozens of times to deliver to your door additional to the times they already have to for larger packages. Just because you and the sender went cheap on the packaging.

Secondly, your purchase contract is with the sender. They choose a carrier. They choose the package. And they choose the way it is delivered. The mail carrier just executes. If you don't want your diploma bent, it needs to be in a tube. A Vinyl record (which is on the front page now) needs to be sent priority with a signature required or in a box big enough that it has to be delivered to the door. If you think you can save ten bucks by mailing it in a small box and write or stamp do not bend on it, then it can, and probably will be bent. If it's not a bad day then many carriers will bring it to the door anyway, but on a bad day they won't. Which is even more important around the holidays because after a federal holiday the carrier has twice as much to deliver in the same amount of time, and is much less likely to be kind and walk it to the door anyway.

Your mailcarrier has 6-7 hours everyday to deliver thousands of pieces of mail, magazines, coupons, and hundreds of packages to literally hundreds of homes. They are on such a time constraint that if they spend more than a minute in the wrong spot according to their tracker then they will get investigated for it. Now imagine out of those hundreds of packages half of them say do not bend. There is literally no way in hell they can get out dozens of times to deliver to your door additional to the times they already have to for larger packages. Just because you and the sender went cheap on the packaging.

Secondly, your purchase contract is with the sender. They choose a carrier. They choose the package. And they choose the way it is delivered. The mail carrier just executes. If you don't want your diploma bent, it needs to be in a tube. A Vinyl record (which is on the front page now) needs to be sent priority with a signature required or in a box big enough that it has to be delivered to the door. If you think you can save ten bucks by mailing it in a small box and write or stamp do not bend on it, then it can, and probably will be bent. If it's not a bad day then many carriers will bring it to the door anyway, but on a bad day they won't. Which is even more important around the holidays because after a federal holiday the carrier has twice as much to deliver in the same amount of time, and is much less likely to be kind and walk it to the door anyway.

You get what you pay for."
YouShouldKnow,c9pyef,YSK restaurants worry about regulars who stop ordering.,"I work at a restaurant and we recently lost a customer. He would order 5-6 times a week every week for the last 10+years.

YouShouldKnow,c9j771,"YSK that various tendon issues like RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) and CTS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) affect more and more people every year, and that there are easy methods to prevent or delay it.","Things like ""[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome)"" or ""[Repetitive Strain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury)"" (RSI) are things many people face who use their hands actively day by day.  


This affects people from many fields, e.g. music (guitarists, and co.), office jobs and gaming (typing, pressing, clicking all day), and even cooks (cutting, etc.). Considering how much ""precision work"" our hands do nowadays, it isn't really uncommon for people to suffer from CTS or RSI anymore - but it can ruin careers and extremely affect quality of life, even for really young people (there are many who are &lt;18 years old and already suffer from RSI due to gaming).  


The problem with injured tendons is that they don't really regenerate much by themselves, and instead form scar tissue which is less elastic and lowers functionality. It may result in simple things becoming difficult to do. Gripping stuff, playing your favorite riff or bassline on a guitar, or cutting onions.  


Since it's easy to prevent or at least delay it, I thought I'd share with you some of the things you can do. Many of these things don't take long.  


First, there are these [stretching exercises](https://imgur.com/a/voLETrx) (or ""range of motion exercises"" that many people do to alleviate present pain coming from strains. It's also kind of like a ""warm up"" for strains, so you can do these exercises before you engage in activities that heavily rely on your strains (even if it's just typing a large text). They don't take long to do and can be done pretty much everywhere. At work, at home, etc.. This one helped me personally (plus a few surgeries I had  


Secondly, symptoms of strain issues are easy to recognize for yourself. Pain is the easiest recognizable part of this. Knowing about [where](https://imgur.com/a/yHKwvad) exactly your strains are will obviously help as well.

* The pain may get worse when you use the tendon.
* You may have more pain and stiffness during the night or when you get up in the morning.
* The area may be tender, red, warm, or swollen if there is inflammation.
* You may notice a crunchy sound or feeling when you use the tendon.

Pay attention to these things. If they happen, cool affected strains regularly and avoid putting them through more activities and alike (get rest for them).  


Try changing your activities or how you do them. For example, if running caused the injury, try swimming some days. If the way you use a tool is the problem, try switching hands or changing your grip.  


If exercise caused the problem, take lessons or ask a trainer or pro to check your technique. To note, you might still have a correct technique, but your strains are used nonetheless.  


If your job caused the tendon injury, ask your HR department if there are other ways to do your job or if you can take up other tasks.  


Obviously, consult a doctor when you have issues. There are medical tools (splints, braces, casts, etc.) to help with this issue more effectively. The stuff above is just more of a ""how to avoid it"". There also is physical therapy and surgeries to help - but it's usually better preventing the issue from occurring in the first place. There also are braces, etc. you can buy online, but they might not perfectly fit you and help the way they should (or even worsen it) - so again, it's usually better consulting your doctor for treatment and alike.",1562350294,"that various tendon issues like RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) and CTS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) affect more and more people every year, and that there are easy methods to prevent or delay it.

The night of July 4th in the US sees the most cases of lost/killed animals by far, much more than any other date. 

It's smart to take precautions for all pets, regardless of how unafraid they may have been of loud noises in the past. Dogs that have been fine in past years can still be unexpectedly spooked.

Here's some tips copied and pasted from [This Link](http://patch.com/california/temecula/4th-july-fireworks-terrifying-pets-safety-tips-follow):

1: Exercise will help your dog relax, so take your dog for a walk and a potty break before the fireworks or festivities begin. Even if you’re in your yard, you may want to leash your dog in case of unexpected noise.

2: Find a safe place indoors for your pet to stay. Ambient noise from a TV, radio, fan or A/C unit can help make pets feel safe.

3: Keep your windows closed.

4: Avoid bringing your dog to your local Independence Day parade.

5: Inspect your fence for openings.

6: Be certain your dog’s tag is readable and up-to-date, his collar is properly fitted and, if your dog has a microchip, the information in the microchip is accurate.

7: Create a quiet place for your dog or cat. Make sure it is cool enough, comfortable enough and away from the celebrations. Once you have located the spot, make it off-limits to guests.

8: If your animal requires prescriptions to cope with the fireworks, make sure you get them well before the Fourth of July holiday. Most veterinarians are closed for the holiday and emergency clinics will not prescribe tranquilizers.

9: If you're having or attending a cook-out with a pet, remind guests to watch their plates and to properly dispose of their garbage. A steak bone/chicken bone or a corn cob is appetizing but can be deadly to your dog or cat.

10: Post notes or signs on back gates or front and rear doors that an animal is present and to be careful to close doors and gates when entering or exiting.

11: Make sure that your pet has on its rabies tags for identification purposes and she is wearing a collar and tag with your name and phone number in case of escape. Most pet stores, such as Petco or Petsmart, have machines inside the store where you can make pet ID tags on the spot.

This is a common tactic of bill/debt collectors, especially with medical bills (which a lot of people rack up in their final days). Debt does not pass to anyone else upon someone's death.

YouShouldKnow,c78vf5,"YSK what your Uber Eats driver sees, and how the delivery process works.","Earlier today I posted a guide to how the Door Dash delivery process works. Several people asked about Uber Eats, so I did some deliveries this afternoon and will walk you through the driver experience with them as well.

When your driver receives an offer for a delivery with Uber Eats [we see a general map that only shows the approximate time to get to the restaurant.](https://imgur.com/a/i9QsWGD). We see no other details about the order, and we have limited time to accept or decline. 

Once accepted, [we see the name of the restaurant,](https://imgur.com/a/UPsVx5k), the mileage to the restaurant, and the approximate time to the restaurant. The time to restaurant is often wrong, due to Uber Eat’s terrible in-app navigation. [We are also shown details of the order.](https://imgur.com/a/vllrrIL) In my experience, it is more common in Uber Eats to receive a sealed bag upon pick-up, so order verification is more difficult. Uber Eats is good though about having realistic pick up times, and I rarely have to wait for an order to be completed. The restaurants have a tablet that shows them a picture of us, so they are able to match our face to your order to make sure the right person is picking it up.

After receiving the order, we have a chance to rate the restaurant with a thumbs up or thumbs down (the restaurant can rate us too), and then we slide a button to start the delivery. 

[This is the first time we are shown where the order is supposed to be delivered.](https://imgur.com/a/VXXwy8L). We have no way of knowing in advance where it will be going or how far we will have to drive. Please note that we also have yet to see any indication of how much the order will pay out, so our decision making abilities are limited. If you have ever been assigned a driver, had them pick up your food or get to the restaurant and then unassign, there is a good chance 1) the wait at the restaurant was too long, or 2) they saw how far the order had to go and unassigned it so someone else could take it.

I also want to mention again just how terrible Uber Eat’s in-app navigation is. [This is an example from earlier today](https://imgur.com/a/ZlSHNvt) when I was sitting in my car in front of the restaurant and Uber wanted me to drive up and down the street some more or something. If your Uber driver seems to be driving in nonsensical circles, they’re probably using Uber’s navigation. We can adjust the settings to use Waze, or we can manually type your address into apple or google maps as well, but that requires shifting between 2 apps while driving, which is not safe. 

Once we get to your house and deliver you your food, we have the option to rate the delivery with a thumbs up or thumbs down, and then we swipe a button to show it was completed. [This is when we get to see what we were paid for the delivery. ](https://imgur.com/a/tyfH32R) This amount does not include your tip.  After an hour or so, if we receive a tip, [we receive a notification](https://imgur.com/a/D4NP5AJ) and our total amount is updated. 

When it comes to pay breakdown, Uber is great about transparency. [Here is a before tip and after tip break down of how I was paid for this delivery.](https://imgur.com/a/EYfVXVF) as well as screen shots outlining [mileage pay and pay for time spent ](https://imgur.com/a/xJEesZy). Note that Uber does NOT pay for mileage driving TO the restaurant, just from the restaurant to the customer’s house. 

Uber Eats is not as popular in my area as Door Dash is, and I hate that I can’t see where I’m taking an order before I accept it. Uber Eats also does not work in “zones” like Door Dash or GrubHub, so you can drive for 50 miles in one direction if your deliveries work out that way. There is no guarantee that we will receive a tip (some of you will appreciate that fact) or a minimum amount for a delivery, so there’s a chance we won’t make enough to cover the gas/wear on our car for the deliveries since we can’t see the pay before we choose to accept. 

The system has pros and cons, but we DO get 100% of the tips on this platform.

YouShouldKnow,c6zn3j,"YSK what your Door Dash driver sees, and how the delivery process works.","There have been some recent posts about Door Dash’s payment model and how they use tips to subsidize the pay of the drivers who they contract. 

The advice is that it’s always better to tip cash (and it’s good advice) but the comment I keep seeing repeated is that people are concerned that if they put a $0.00 tip in the app, they will somehow receive substandard service. I want to walk you through what we see as drivers and how the delivery process goes to alleviate any concerns about leaving a $0.00 tip in the app and tipping in cash. 

PLEASE NOTE: Please don’t take this as a suggestion that you shouldn’t tip your driver. We work hard and do our best to get your food to you. We appreciate your appreciation. 

When we’re logged on and receive an offer, the screen changes [to look like this. ](https://imgur.com/a/3Epp7wC) We see a map that shows the general area, a mileage total, total number of items, and a guaranteed payout. The guarantee is important because it’s what we use to decide whether or not we will take an order. General rule of thumb is never accept an order which pays less than $1/mile. Note that we cannot see a specific tip amount, just the total.

Once we accept the offer we head to the restaurant, and when we get to the restaurant we slide a button to confirm that we’ve arrived. We are [then shown a screen which shows your order details.](https://imgur.com/a/R5dFTpg)This screen also shows any special requests you’ve made in regards to preparation, modifications, or substitutions. 

We let the restaurant know that we’ve arrived and are given your order. If the bag is not sealed, we can look to make sure all items are included, however we cannot open boxes or packages to make sure it was prepared right. If the bag is sealed, we cannot open it to check anything and have to take the restaurant’s word for it. If you receive an order with missing items or incorrectly prepared food, please contact Door Dash customer service. The rating you give your dasher should only be a reflection of the delivery itself, not the preparation or absence of items as that is often outside of our control. 

After we receive the order, we slide a button on the app verifying pickup and [showing us your address along with any delivery instructions.](https://imgur.com/a/r5VqFFB) If you have a gate code or any requests for the delivery itself, this is where we see them. Instructions to your building in an apartment complex are helpful as well. At this point we have already left the restaurant, so any requests regarding food preparation or additions to your order cannot be accommodated. It’s too late by this point. 

Once we have handed you your food we swipe the button to confirm delivery [and are shown how much we were paid and whether or not a tip was included.](https://imgur.com/a/UcZlRfh) This order is a good example of the concern regarding Door Dash’s handling of tips. This customer was generous and tipped $5, but Door Dash used that $5 towards the guarantee and only paid $1.21 to the Dasher. If the customer had tipped $5 cash instead, Door Dash would have paid the full $6.21 guarantee and the dasher would have received $11.21 total for that delivery. 

[Here are some more examples of various payouts.](https://imgur.com/a/CXtrKT4)

The process can vary greatly from person to person and therapists are there to provide support for your specific needs.

YouShouldKnow,c44bch,YSK: You can control your dreams. It’s called lucid dreaming and is a learnable skill that you can master and do EVERY night.,"For most people, dreams are like a movie. You watch them play out and hope you get a good ending. But for others like myself, dreams are a hyper-realistic sandbox video game.

Lucid dreaming is when you become aware that you’re dreaming inside a dream. From there, you can **control it and do anything you want**. It’s not very popular so I thought I’d make a post telling you guys what it is and how to do it.

Why should you care?
You experience 11% of all known reality in a dream, so why not learn to control it and do whatever you want, every night? Lucid dreaming is amazing and feels **just as vivid real life**. All five of your senses are engaged (you can eat, smell, touch, etc). You can fly, spawn in objects or people, visit places... you name it. It’s such a cool thing to do and I think you deserve to know about it.

Here’s one of many scientific studies done on lucid dreaming:
http://lucidity.com/SleepAndCognition.html

So how can I do it?
If you’ve never heard of lucid dreaming before, you automatically have an extremely high chance of experiencing a lucid dream **tonight** simply by reading this and putting the idea into your head. You’ll have an even better chance if you use a technique like FILD or WBTB.

If you want to learn how to do this every night, I recommend watching some [video tutorials on how to lucid dream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF_gxHcSIPIyCV31oa1wWpA) so that you learn the proper techniques!",1561295008,"You can control your dreams.

But for others like myself, dreams are a hyper-realistic sandbox video game.

Lucid dreaming is when you become aware that you’re dreaming inside a dream. From there, you can **control it and do anything you want**. It’s not very popular so I thought I’d make a post telling you guys what it is and how to do it.

Why should you care?
You experience 11% of all known reality in a dream, so why not learn to control it and do whatever you want, every night? Lucid dreaming is amazing and feels **just as vivid real life**. All five of your senses are engaged (you can eat, smell, touch, etc). You can fly, spawn in objects or people, visit places... you name it. It’s such a cool thing to do and I think you deserve to know about it.

Here’s one of many scientific studies done on lucid dreaming:


So how can I do it?
If you’ve never heard of lucid dreaming before, you automatically have an extremely high chance of experiencing a lucid dream **tonight** simply by reading this and putting the idea into your head. You’ll have an even better chance if you use a technique like FILD or WBTB.

YouShouldKnow,c409r4,YSK: How to order a pizza from Dominos (for the best deal),"I am an insider at Dominos and I recently had the best interaction with an Uber driver which has inspired me to write this. He was telling me how he liked the Philly Steak sandwich we sell but how the specialty pizza is too expensive. I told him it is because the specialities are over priced and we can not give any coupon discounts for them, but there is a work around if you tell them you want to use a coupon and tell them the exact toppings the specialty would have had, and that he’d get the same pizza for a fraction of the cost. He was elated by the tip and gave me my Uber ride for free. 

The best deal is probably the carry out deal for a large 3 topping for $7.99.

For delivery the best deal is probably the large any way you want it for $13.99, but there is also a $3.50 delivery charge, and you should tip the drivers as well. So really carry out is your best bet for saving money.",1561272231,"How to order a pizza from Dominos (for the best deal) I am an insider at Dominos and I recently had the best interaction with an Uber driver which has inspired me to write this.

YouShouldKnow,c3aayz,YSK that sleeping more isn't always better (and I'm not talking about oversleeping),"There are around 1.5 hour long sleep cycles that our body goes through, each consisting of 4 phases, the last phase being the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) or dreaming phase. On average, we sleep through 5 cycles at night (hence 7.5 hours). The first two phases result in a light sleep while the other 2 are phases of deep sleep.

The important thing is that waking up during the second half of a sleep cycle (in the last 2 phases) disrupts deep sleep, and leaves you tired and groggy. Thus, for eg. if you have just 3 hours of time left to sleep, consider delaying sleep for another hour and setting an alarm for 2 hours, so that you don't wake up in the middle of a deep phase of the second cycle, and instead wake up in a lighter phase.

It's also the reason why it is advised to take short naps of around 25-30 minutes rather than an hour long nap.

TL;DR : We oscillate through periods of light and deep sleep. Waking up during a deep sleep phase feels awful.

YouShouldKnow,c2p9ct,YSK how an emergency department's triage and flow process works (USA),"Most emergency departments in the US use a triage system that uses 1 through 5 for acuity with slight variations, some are color coded, some reverse the scale but the concept is the same; very sick to not at all sick. In this example 1 is someone who if not seen in the next few minutes will likely significantly worsen, die, or is already trying their best to be dead. Think impending respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, GSW to the torso, actively seizing, unresponsive. The opposite of that, level 5, is someone who could wait in the waiting room for literal weeks and will not likely die. Think voluntary STI screening without symptoms, chronic symptoms that are not changed, or medication refill for a non essential medication.

 &amp;nbsp;

The system takes into account as many objective pieces of data as possible such as chief complaint, vitals, gender, age, medical conditions, etc. There is sometimes a little wiggle room for triage level but most often not. Additionally this looks at the grand scheme or big picture of illness, so even though you may feel very sick with something like the flu you may not be triaged as sicker because some of the other factors. For example: a person who says they are having 10 out of 10 pain but has completely normal vital signs and are playing on their phone, walking without difficulty, and are otherwise healthy is not going to be triaged as highly as someone with similar concerns but looks very sick and has abnormal vital signs.

 &amp;nbsp;

You will be seen and evaluated by a nurse and assigned a triage number. Occasionally, if the emergency department isn't busy you will just get to go back to a room and they will complete the triage process there.

 &amp;nbsp;

Now comes the waiting part. If you are a level 1 you will be seen as soon as a doctor is available. Sometimes the doctor gets pulled out of other rooms (including in the middle of seeing you) if the other patient is ultra sick. If you are a level 2 you will wait for any level 1s that come in at any point from you getting there to you being seen and any level 2s that have been waiting longer. Similarly if you are a level 3 you will wait for any level 1 and any level 2 and every level 3 that has been waiting longer than you. Etc etc. ie if you are a level 5 (least sick) you will wait for a long long long time at most busy EDs. This often applies even when you have already been roomed.

 &amp;nbsp;

Even if the waiting room is not busy that doesn't mean the actual rooms aren't all full with patients who are still being evaluated. Additionally EMS crews bringing patients in by ambulance sometimes have priority for rooms (please don't abuse this, EDs absolutely put people brought in by EMS in triage to wait like everyone else, you will be charged more and piss people off if you abuse EMS). On top of that is staffing issues meaning not every room can be used and a certain number of rooms have to be kept for level 1 patients who may show up.

 &amp;nbsp;

Sometimes emergency departments have what could be thought of as a built in ""urgent care"" where certain rooms are designated for things like sore throats and other minor concerns in healthy people where people are seen with more limited resources. So you may see people who don't look sick getting called back to a room before you even if you've been waiting a long time.

 &amp;nbsp;

There are variations, and the staff do their best to see people in a timely manner while also treating the sickest patients. The downside of triage and limited resources is that you may wait longer than you would like. The good news with that is that if you are waiting longer it probably means that you are not the sickest person in the ED.",1560991809,"how an emergency department's triage and flow process works (USA) Most emergency departments in the US use a triage system that uses 1 through 5 for acuity with slight variations, some are color coded, some reverse the scale but the concept is the same; very sick to not at all sick.

YouShouldKnow,c278o1,YSK about what's happening in Sudan.,"So recently, there have been a lot of violence that's been happening in Sudan. This post is for those of you who don't know what's happening. If you watch the news all the time and you're still clueless, then don't worry, the media never covers the stuff that's most important.

Officially called The Republic Of Sudan, Sudan is a small country in North Africa. Recently there has been a LOT of violence against the innocent. Why? Well, read on.

Way back in 1989, Omar Al Bashir, took reign over Sudan and has kept his reign with the help of ""majority"" votes. At this point North Sudan and South Sudan is the same as India and Pakistan in 1947. But soon a peace treaty was signed and South Sudan was guaranteed Independence in the few coming years. This went on for some time and in 2010 south Sudan was an independent country. The problem? They lost control over their oil fields. Which was a maaajor economic blow to the country and it's people. Soon the prices of oil was also increased. Now, the people don't have money AND the prices of oil are soaring high. This leads to PEACEFUL protests by the people, but of course it had no effect at all.

Cut to 2018. Prices have increased again and the economic crisis has never been this bad before. So peaceful protests by the people break out again, but this time they're asking for Bashir to step down. Apparently, big mistake. Now Bashir is pissed off and he refuses to step down and then subjects the people to police brutality. Protests are now illegal. 

Cut to 2019. No more mobile towers, no more internet. Everyone is being attacked. Bashir has now closed the Sudan borders, no More flights. If you're in Sudan, you die in Sudan. Bashir imposes a state of emergency and orders the army to ""squash"" the protesters. 

In one day, over 100 people killed. Out of which about 40 bodies dumped in the Nile river. Over 500 injured. Hospitals vandalised, doctors killed so that the injured cannot be treated. Over 500 women raped, over 50 men raped. Children, women, men slaughtered alike. 

Remember notre dame? The church that burned down, had 0 deaths, 1 injured and 1 EMPTY building burnt? Well, did you know that that incident raised $1,000,000,000? 

I have some very disturbing images that was shared to me, not sure if it's original or if it's edited hence not going to share. If it is real, then damn. God save humanity.

YouShouldKnow,bvkm12,YSK that glass bottles are bad for the environment,"The production of glass is hard on the environment. Assuming both kinds are made from new materials, the production of glass bottles emits nine times more carbon than with plastic bottles. With recycled plastic, it’s far higher.


Glass bottles are far heavier than plastic bottles of the same size. Heavier and less space-efficient bottles have more of an environmental impact, as more fuel has to be burned to transport it. The weight of glass bottles makes the emissions related to transport over ten times higher than they would have been with plastic bottles.


1000 liters of liquid distributed on 0.75 liter glass bottles causes the release of 875 kg CO2-equivalents on average. In comparison, the same amount of liquid distributed by plastic bottles (and recycled with the norwegian system) releases between 6.6 and 125 kg, depending on the amount of recycled material in the bottles. 


What many worry about with plastic, is that it gets released into nature. That is not the case when the plastic products are properly recycled. This can be endorsed with systems such as (the Norwegian plastic bottle and aluminum can recycling system)[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42953038], which has lead to 97% of norwegian bottles being returned. With it, the bottles are melted down, allowing for easy handling and space-efficient transportation. Every country should adopt a similar system, as it is profitable for everyone. 


One of the major problems with plastic, is that right now, it’s cheaper to make new plastic than to recycle. That is bad for the environment, but still not as bad as glass bottles are.

YouShouldKnow,buqa5h,"YSK that if you feel depressed and feel like a therapist would just turn you away because your problems aren't 'serious enough', you should still go and talk to a professional. The feeling that your problems are insignificant is actually a symptom of depression.","Seriously, I see this misconception repeated so much all over the internet. A lot of people really believe a therapist would just turn them away. By no means do you have to be ""obviously"" mentally ill to seek help. Depression and mental illnesses have many ways of manifesting. 

I am here to tell you that any therapist, counsellor, psychologist etc that turns away or belittles someone that comes to them saying they're depressed should lose their job.

The DSM has the criteria that therapy is a good option when social, work, or personal life is impaired by symptoms. Even if you get good marks at school or perform good work, the feeling of drowning or struggling is an indicator of impairment, and can often lead to burnout. Managing well on external indicators says nothing about what's going on internally. 

Symptoms for depression can include feelings of anhedonia (loss of ability to feel pleasure), over or under sleeping, unexplained weight changes, declining to maintain social relationships, and a host of other things. If you suspect it is affecting you, there's a good chance you are right.  

So hopefully someone sees this post, bites the bullet, and finally sees the therapist they've been thinking about. It is very common to spend a long time 'screwing up the courage', but please definitely go sooner rather than later.

So hopefully someone sees this post, bites the bullet, and finally sees the therapist they've been thinking about. It is very common to spend a long time 'screwing up the courage', but please definitely go sooner rather than later. 

Good luck and good health to anyone out there struggling."

YouShouldKnow,bpasfr,YSK how to help someone in a panic attack,"A [panic attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack) is a moment when a person is at their most vulnerable. They can be frozen in place or frantically fleeing. They will be out of breath, trembling, sweating, experiencing high anxiety. Symptoms can vary between persons.

This Tuesday I had a really bad panic attack when I was not at home. Someone found me and helped me. I was lucky that they knew what to do. To make sure that people like me are helped by people that know what to do, a couple of tips:

1. Ask simple questions to get information. ""Are you in a panic attack?"" is a nice one to make sure that it's not a physical danger. 
2. Not everyone is comfortable with touch, so I'd advise staying away or at least asking if they are OK with being touched. 
3. Help them to get back their breath. Sit down next to them and tell them to breathe out a bit more slowly and deeply. Then a bit more. Keep the rhythm that you have with your own breathing.
4. Help them to breathe and become calm by talking. Simple questions again. ""What is your name?"" ""How old are you?"" 
5. Ask them what you could do, again simply. ""Can I take you to the porter of this building for help?"" ""Do you want to go home?"" ""Can I get you some water?"" -- Notice that these are yes/no questions. If the person cannot talk, it is still possible to answer by head movements.
6. If they want you to help them get home or get to help, make sure that you do that in a safe way. For example, the person that helped me, helped me use public transport to get home. So I did not have to worry about sitting in a car with an unknown person. 
7. If you go somewhere with them, walk slowly, take the most quiet route, and ask them to say it when they feel uncomfortable by something you do. 
8. If it's bad, you can to the ER with an issue like this (in the Netherlands). There will be doctors prepared to talk with people to calm them down. They can even get someone from the psychiatric department to help one. I don't know how it is in other countries (I assume it will be horribly expensive in the US?).\\

I hope you can use these tips to help someone with mental problems to become calm and get on their way safely!

It helps clear up traffic on the street.  Also this helps those with anxiety about parallel parking.

*\* REFERENCE POINT 1:*  **REAR BUMPER**

Pull up next to the car parked in front until your rear bumper lines up with the other car’s rear bumper.  If both cars are similar in size and length, then you line up your car’s right mirror with the front car’s left mirror.  Both cars should now be parallel and about 2 feet between the mirrors or 3 feet apart door-to-door.

Turn your steering wheel to the right.  It should be 1 full turn of 360 degrees.

1. Except in rare circumstances, **drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help**. The respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled, before speech occurs.

YouShouldKnow,barw9p,"YSK that spring is coming, and so are ticks - here's how to identify, avoid, and remove them","# Awareness

* **Weather**: ticks are most active after the rain. Moulting requires [warm, damp conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_and_climate_effects_on_Lyme_disease_exposure#Climate). As a result, ticks seeking a new host are most common two to three days after rain breaks a dry period.
* **Terrain**: because ticks prefer warm and damp, they are most common on the islands and coastal areas. The CDC has an interesting set of [species distribution maps for ticks in the USA](http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html), and your regional health authority might have some for your own country.
* **Know your enemy**: learn about the [lifecycle of the tick](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaPSv.jpg) in order to understand when, where, and how to best avoid it. Did you know that ticks are not insects? They are a type of mite, and belong to the order of arachnids, along with spiders and scorpions.
* **Why don't we just eradicate them?** As unpleasant as they are for humans ([and livestock](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1635821/)), ticks serve an important but poorly-understood role in the ecosystem. They are food for other animals, they host and transport other microorganisms, and they help to balance populations of the animals they prey on which affects overpopulation and overgrazing.

# Prevention

* **Tuck your socks in**: although ticks often climb high and grab passers-by, they are most commonly found in tall grass rather than in trees, and will simply climb upwards on your clothing.
* [**Treat fabrics with permethrin**](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html): you'll see this recommended on a lot of hiking blogs, so you can look for 0.5% but **be cautious** because permethrin is a pyrethroid which are [known](http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/pyrethrins-ziram/pyrethrins-ext.html) to be [toxic](http://www.anapsid.org/pyrethroids.html) (people have died from low doses, especially when inhaled), so overuse could be harmful. As with all chemicals, it's good to [know what you are dealing with](http://www.tickencounter.org/prevention/permethrin). Anecdotal evidence has suggested that grapefruit oil is a good natural alternative to permethrin.
* **Wear darker clothing**: studies found that ticks are [more likely to be attracted to you if you wear lighter-coloured clothing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16051573). However, they are easier to spot crawling on light-coloured clothing, so it's something of a compromise.
* **On your body**: ticks are very small, and deer ticks (the type that spread Lyme disease) are so tiny that it takes very little for them to hide. They can stay latched on for up to three days, and prefer to hide in moist, dark crevices - so pay particular attention to the hairline, underarms, groin, ankles, and behind the knees.
* **Have somebody else check you**. Tick nymphs are [incredibly small, hard to detect or feel, and can easily be out of your sight range](https://i0.wp.com/www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/Lifestyle/condition-specific/lyme-disease/blacklegged_ticks.jpg?w=1155&amp;h=1908). It's important to have another pair of eyes checking for suspicious black lumps, so don't be too shy about it.

# Removal

* **Check regularly!** It is impossible to remove a tick promptly if you are not aware of its presence. The [Lyme Disease Organisation](https://www.lymedisease.org/hard-science-on-lyme-ticks-can-transmit-infection-the-first-day/) says that Lyme can be transmitted in the first 24 hours, and even as early as 6 hours in an extreme case, although 36 hours is the normal window. Most tick prevention takes advantage of that time lapse and kills the tick faster than the tick can transmit disease.
* **Tick removal tools** ([fork](https://www.amazon.ca/Twister-Removal-Remover-Hunting-Fishing/dp/B0089BOK12/ref=pd_sim_200_1/163-1027747-4543831) or [pincer](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001QC34GI) types) reduce the risk of squeezing the tick when attempting removal, as can happen with fingernails or tweezers, which can force the tick to vomit inside the bite, spreading the infection.
* **Twist or pull?** The [CDC recommends pulling straight](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html), because twisting can cause the head to break off (the exception here is removal tools which are specially designed to use a twisting motion). In general:
   * The tick's body must not be compressed, as this can force it to vomit disease-causing organisms.
   * The tick should not be irritated or injured, for the same reason (for example, smothering, freezing, or burning it).
   * The mouth parts of the tick should be cleanly removed along with the rest of its body.

# Cure

* **Seek medical help!** Dr Keystone, a tropical disease physician at a major Toronto hospital, [says](http://www.uhn.ca/corporate/News/Pages/what_is_bugging_you_part_three_ticks.aspx) that ""What we now know is that if you receive a single dose of [doxycycline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline) within 72 hours after removal of a tick that has been attached for more than 36 hours, infection can be prevented.""
   * However, you should make sure to get a proper diagnosis first, and let the doctor judge when to give doxycycline so that it's given when actually needed, rather than preventatively. This is due to its [unpleasant side effects](https://www.rxlist.com/consumer_doxycycline/drugs-condition.htm) which you should prefer to avoid.
   * Even if you find a tick quickly, don't assume you are completely safe. Despite the CDC's 24-48 hour window for Lyme disease, [a review carried out in 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4278789/) states that the minimum time needed has never been established, noting six cases where Lyme disease had been transmitted in less than 6 hours; other diseases may be passed within minutes.
* **Keep the tick if possible**, in a ziploc bag or wrapped in Scotch tape. If you have any concerns about the nature of your tick bite (or especially if you see any redness around the bite area - [concentric red rings](http://lymediseaseguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lyme-disease-rash.png) are a sign of Lyme's Disease), seal the tick and freeze it.
   * In addition to Lyme's Disease, ticks can also carry and transmit [dozens of other nasty things](https://lymediseaseassociation.org/category/about-lyme/other-tick-borne-diseases/) (also [listed at CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/diseases/index.html)), including borreliosis, bartonellosis, ehrlichiosis, encephalitis, ricketts, and more.
   * Bringing the source tick to your hospital if you find an infection can help the medical staff to quickly identify what type it was, and what bacteria or diseases it might have been carrying (although some, like borreliosis, are a clinical diagnosis and don't require an investigation of the tick).

# Errata

* Ticks are ancient, and were literally a problem for dinosaurs. They first appear in the fossil record during the Cretaceous (between 66 and 145 million years ago), and the [oldest known fossil tick](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-tick) (*Carlos jerseyi*), discovered in a piece of amber in New Jersey, is 90 million years old.
* Despite looking like insects, ticks are actually arachnids, meaning that they are more closely related to spiders and scorpions. Larval ticks only have six legs, but the other two appear later on. It can take up to three years for larvae to mature to the adult stage and reproduce.

One of these, the [Lone Star tick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyomma_americanum) indigenous to the eastern USA and Mexico, causes [alpha-gal syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20428608), an allergy to red meat in humans but which does not affect dogs or cats.

Taking antibiotics when not necessary will do nothing to help, and can do more harm by making them less effective in the future.","Antibiotic resistance is a very real thing and the overuse or misuse of antibiotics can create super strains of bacteria that are immune to antibiotics. 

I just finished up my bachelors of science in Human biology with an emphasis in neuroscience last year. I plan to head into the medical field and I started working at a medical facility. We get an alarming number of people coming in asking for antibiotics because they think they need them for the flu. 

Antibiotics work most often by “punching” holes in a cell wall of a bacteria or by preventing cell walls from being built in the first place. This means the bacteria cannot survive and thus eliminates an infection such as a UTI for example (Urinary Tract Infection).

A virus on the other hand is not a living cell, and is DNA or RNA (genetic material) surrounded by a protein coat. Antibiotics have nothing to “attack” on a virus and as such will do nothing whatsoever to help. 

If you are prescribed antibiotics by a doctor, take the full bottle as prescribed even if you are feeling better towards the end. Not finishing the course can leave traces of the bacteria to regrow, and developing resistance to the antibiotic.

YouShouldKnow,au3jh4,YSK about the 'check in' tool if you are having trouble with whatever you are currently feeling.,"If you are feeling anxious, nervous, or any other feelings that you may have trouble expressing, one tool that can be used is called the ""check in"" and it goes like this:

I'm feeling/was feeling \_\_\_\_\_ (make sure this is an actual emotion, not a belief. For example saying ""I feel hurt"" is different from saying ""I feel like you attacked me"".)

I feel this way when \_\_\_\_\_ happens (this part is the objective trigger, key word ""objective"". To stay with the above example, saying ""you called me a liar"" is much different from saying ""you attacked me"".)

I feel this way because I believe \_\_\_\_\_ (this is part is the subjective trigger. Here it's acceptable to say something like ""I believe your intention was to attack and hurt me"", but be sure to stay clear that this is your perception, not something objective.)

what I notice in my body is \_\_\_\_\_ (what are the sensations in your body that tell you you're feeling the way you do?)

I choose to respond by \_\_\_\_\_

\--------------------------------------------------------

To give you an example:

I am feeling nervous and hopeful.

I feel this way when I share an explanation of the check-in format.

I feel this way because I think my words may not be effective or helpful. However, I also think that I have a responsibility to share ideas that may help people fix their problems even when their lives are largely out of my control.

What I notice in my body is shallow breathing and a bright energetic sensation in my chest and throat.

I choose to respond by letting go of my attachment to other people's actions and just share the idea.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Of course, nobody really expresses themselves exactly like that. But any thorough discussion about your feelings will have those elements in some form or another. The check in is also helpful if you just want to work out exactly how you're feeling. And nobody even has to know that you're doing it. Self-awareness is critical for good communication.

If you are feeling anxious, nervous, or any other feelings that you may have trouble expressing, one tool that can be used is called the ""check in"" and it goes like this:

I'm feeling/was feeling \_\_\_\_\_ (make sure this is an actual emotion, not a belief. For example saying ""I feel hurt"" is different from saying ""I feel like you attacked me"".)

I feel this way when \_\_\_\_\_ happens (this part is the objective trigger, key word ""objective"". To stay with the above example, saying ""you called me a liar"" is much different from saying ""you attacked me"".)

I feel this way because I believe \_\_\_\_\_ (this is part is the subjective trigger. Here it's acceptable to say something like ""I believe your intention was to attack and hurt me"", but be sure to stay clear that this is your perception, not something objective.)

what I notice in my body is \_\_\_\_\_ (what are the sensations in your body that tell you you're feeling the way you do?)

I choose to respond by \_\_\_\_\_

\--------------------------------------------------------

To give you an example:

I am feeling nervous and hopeful.

I feel this way when I share an explanation of the check-in format.

I feel this way because I think my words may not be effective or helpful. However, I also think that I have a responsibility to share ideas that may help people fix their problems even when their lives are largely out of my control.

What I notice in my body is shallow breathing and a bright energetic sensation in my chest and throat.

I choose to respond by letting go of my attachment to other people's actions and just share the idea.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Of course, nobody really expresses themselves exactly like that. But any thorough discussion about your feelings will have those elements in some form or another. The check in is also helpful if you just want to work out exactly how you're feeling. And nobody even has to know that you're doing it. Self-awareness is critical for good communication.

YouShouldKnow,9k731e,YSK that “D” boobs aren’t as big as you think they are.,"When people talk about “big” boobs they talk about Ds or the magical DDs and imagine some giant cantaloupe sized bags of sand. In reality though, D-DD is at the relatively small-average end of the scale. While many big box stores only go up to D-DD, stores that specialize in bras have a scale like this-


US: A, B, C, **D**, E (DD), F (DDD), G, H, I, J, K+...

UK: A, B, C, D, DD, E (DDD), F, FF, G, GG... 

What we think of as a D-DD is more accurately sized to a F-H. I believe this disconnect comes from those big box stores, for example:


Janet has some melons on her chest, but the biggest the store sells is DD so she buys it and squeezes her boobs together for that oh so sexy “butt cleavage” look. Her cups probably don’t even fully hold her boobs, and it can’t be comfortable-but hey, that’s the biggest size so it must just be how bras fit at that size! Victoria secret sells cleavage so nothings wrong. Well, this has a sort of trickle-down, where a proper “D” girl sees that and thinks “there’s no way I’m that size if *shes* wearing it!” So she stuffs into a B-C and so it goes. 


Secondly **band size**.. anybody who has learned of bra fitting, knows that the letter means nothing without the band size. What really grinds my gears again about big box stores, is that there’s a belief that if you have a smaller frame, you can’t have a cup size larger than a C-D (*shakes fist in anger*). That’s not how it works. The cup size is-with the simplest calculation-the difference between the measurement around the ribs just below the breasts, and the measurement of the fullest part of the breasts. You can’t get the cup without the band. 
Here](https://m.imgur.com/sgVBBND) is a a SFW diagram of the relationship between cup and band sizes. 


So when someone says “she’s got Ds” it doesn’t tell me much. A 30D is much much MUCH smaller than a 36D. With bra sizing, a 30D is equal in volume to a 36A (if you add a band you subtract a cup to find the comparative size at that band).. it’s all proportionate. 


I'm writing this because I'd love for there to be more awareness about bra sizes, wearing the wrong size is uncomfortable, and being scoffed at when someone says ""you can't be more than a &lt;insert smaller size here&gt;"" is a shitty feeling. It also makes me feel awkward to ask for my true size. Ladies, just because some big box stores only go up to DD, there are plenty of resources online like Amazon, Bravissimo, or Nordstroms that do have larger cup sizes. I encourage women and men to research this more to help change these misconceptions.

YouShouldKnow,9jnbg4,YSK: If you are a victim of abuse of any kind- it’s not your fault! You can heal- through self-compassion and compassion from others. You don’t deserve to feel shame and you are not to blame for the things that happened to you.,"Being a victim doesn’t mean you’re weak, it doesn’t mean you’re bad, it means something bad happened to your control.

Don’t let shame hijack your life. You deserve better. 

Here’s some information from this great [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-compassion-chronicles/201501/healing-the-shame-childhood-abuse-through-self-compassion?amp)- heal shame with self-compassion. (for all abuse not just childhood abuse)

&gt; Shame is Not a Singular Experience

&gt; Just as the source of shame can be all forms of abuse or neglect, shame is not just one feeling but many. It is a cluster of feelings and experiences. These can include:

&gt; Feelings of being humiliated. Abuse is always humiliating to the victim, but some types are more humiliating than others. Certainly, sexual abuse almost always has an element of humiliation to it, since it is a violation of very private body parts and since there is a knowing on the child’s part that incest and/or sex between a child and an adult is taboo. (These taboos hold in nearly every culture in the world.) If the abuse involves public exposure—for example, being chastised or physically punished in front of others, particularly peers—the element of humiliation can be quite profound.

&gt; Feelings of impotence. When a child realizes there is nothing he can do to stop the abuse, he feels powerless, helpless. This can also lead to his always feeling unsafe, even long after the abuse has stopped.

&gt; Feelings of being exposed. Abuse and the accompanying feelings of vulnerability and helplessness cause the child to feel self-conscious and exposed—seen in a painfully diminished way. The fact that he could not stop the abuse makes him feel weak and exposed both to himself and to anyone present.

&gt; Feelings of being defective or less-than. Most victims of abuse report feeling defective, damaged, or corrupted following the experience of being abused.

&gt; Feelings of alienation and isolation. What follows the trauma of abuse is the feeling of suddenly being different, less-than, damaged, or cast out. And while victims may long to talk to someone about their inner pain, they often feel immobilized, trapped, and alone in their shame.

&gt; Feelings of self-blame. Victims almost always blame themselves for being abused and being shamed. This is particularly true when abuse happens or begins in childhood.

&gt; Feelings of rage. Rage almost always follows having been shamed. It serves a much-needed self-protective function of both insulating the self against further exposure and actively keeping others away.

&gt; Fear, hurt, distress, or rage can also accompany or follow shame experiences as secondary reactions. For example, feeling exposed is often followed by fear of further exposure and further occurrences of shame. Rage protects the self against further exposure. And along with shame, a victim can feel intense hurt and distress from having been abused.

&gt; The following exercise can help you discover what your primary feeling experiences of shame are.

&gt; Exercise: Your Feeling Experience of Shame

&gt; While you may have experienced all the feelings listed above, you may resonate with some more than others. Think about each type of abuse that you suffered and the various feelings that accompanied it. Ask yourself which of the items listed above stand out to you the most for each type of abuse, or each experience of abuse. In my case, for example, when I think about the sexual abuse I suffered at age nine, I resonate most profoundly with defectiveness, isolation, self-blame, and rage.

&gt; Further Defining Self-Compassion

&gt; If compassion is the ability to feel and connect with the suffering of another human being, self-compassion is the ability to feel and connect with one’s own suffering. More specifically for our purposes, self-compassion is the act of extending compassion to one’s self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general suffering. If we are to be self-compassionate, we need to give ourselves the recognition, validation, and support we would offer a loved one who is suffering.

&gt; Kristin Neff, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, is the leading researcher in the growing field of self-compassion. In her book Self-Compassion (2011), she defines self-compassion as “being open to and moved by one’s own suffering, experiencing feelings of caring and kindness toward oneself, taking an understanding, nonjudgmental attitude toward one’s inadequacies and failures, and recognizing that one’s experience is part of the common human experience"" (224).

&gt; Self-compassion encourages us to begin to treat ourselves and talk to ourselves with the same kindness, caring, and compassion we would show a good friend or a beloved child. Just as connecting with the suffering of others has been shown to comfort and heal, connecting with our own suffering will do the same. If you are able to feel compassion toward others, you can learn to feel it for yourself; the following exercise will show you how.

&gt; Exercise: Becoming Compassionate Toward Yourself

&gt; 1. Think about the most compassionate person you have known—someone kind, understanding, and supportive of you. It may have been a teacher, a friend, a friend’s parent, a relative. Think about how this person conveyed his or her compassion toward you and how you felt in this person’s presence. Notice the feelings and sensations that come up with this memory. If you can’t think of someone in your life who has been compassionate toward you, think of a compassionate public figure, or even a fictional character from a book, film, or television.

&gt; 2. Now imagine that you have the ability to become as compassionate toward yourself as this person has been toward you (or you imagine this person would be toward you). How would you treat yourself if you were feeling overwhelmed with sadness or shame? What kinds of words would you use to talk to yourself?

&gt; This is the goal of self-compassion: to treat yourself the same way the most compassionate person you know would treat you—to talk to yourself in the same loving, kind, supportive ways this compassionate person would talk to you.

&gt; The Benefits of Practicing Self-Compassion

&gt; By learning to practice self-compassion you will also be able to begin doing the following:

&gt; o Truly acknowledge the pain you suffered and in so doing, begin to heal

&gt; o Take in compassion from others

&gt; o Reconnect with yourself, including reconnecting with your emotions

&gt; o Gain an understanding as to why you have acted out in negative and/or unhealthy ways

&gt; o Stop blaming yourself for your victimization

&gt; o Forgive yourself for the ways you attempted to cope with the abuse

&gt; o Learn to be deeply kind toward yourself

&gt; o Create a nurturing inner voice to replace your critical inner voice

&gt; o Reconnect with others and become less isolated


I hope this helps. Change doesn’t happen all at once, be kind to yourself, be forgiving and take baby steps.",1538144105,"If you are a victim of abuse of any kind- it’s not your fault!

Direct links are below.  

[Maryland Hurricane Evacuation Lookup Tool](https://maryland.maps.arcgis.com/apps/InformationLookup/index.html?appid=abef1ee97e254dd7a8b55cc179e29d6c)

[Virginia Hurricane Evacuation Zone Lookup Tool](https://vdemgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5797524b9a58440c8dbc06816e060492)

Those is other locations should check to see if their state has a similar tool.

Additional information from FEMA:

* Know your zone. Evacuations are more common than people realize. Many communities have designated evacuation routes and some even have evacuation zones. Make yourself familiar with these evacuation zones, so if your local authorities issue an evacuation order, you’ll know exactly where to go. Be sure to account for your pets, as most local shelters do not permit them. However, by law, public shelters do accept service animals (e.g., dogs). Remember: if a hurricane threatens your community and local officials say it's time to evacuate, don't hesitate -- go early. 

* Complete a family communication plan. Plan how you will assemble your family and loved ones, and anticipate where you will go for different situations. Choose several destinations in different directions so you have options in an emergency, and know the evacuation routes to get to those destinations. Get together with your family and agree on the ways to contact one another in an emergency, identify meeting locations, and make a Family Emergency Communication Plan.

* Sign up for local alerts on your phone. Sign up now so you can stay aware if the weather gets worse. Visit https://www.ready.gov/alerts and learn how to search for local alerts and weather apps that are relevant for hazards that affect your area. Download the FEMA app for disaster resources, weather alerts, and safety tips. Earlier this month, FEMA launched a new feature to its free smartphone app that will enable users to receive push notifications to their devices to remind them to take important steps to prepare their homes and families for disasters. The app also provides a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, maps of open shelters and open recovery centers, tips on how to survive natural and manmade disasters, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations across the nation. 

* Make sure your insurance policies are up to date. Hurricanes have caused eight of the ten costliest disasters in U.S. history and just a few inches of water, or strong winds, can cause tens of thousands of dollars in damage. Many states have increased deductibles for hurricanes and not all hurricane related losses are covered under traditional policies. Also, most homeowners insurance policies do not cover damage or losses from flooding. Flood insurance ensures that consumers have adequate financial protection against the devastating effects of flooding, without having to rely on post-disaster loans (usually paid back with interest) or emergency assistance. If you have insurance, review your policy, ensure you’re adequately covered and understand exclusions, and contact your agent for any changes. If you’re not insured against flood, talk to your agent or visit floodsmart.gov. Renters insurance policies are also available and should be considered as they’re often low-cost methods of protecting your belongings.

* Get prepared now and know what you’re going to do in the event of a hurricane. Planning ahead gives you more options and better control over situations that could become chaotic at the last moment if you’re not ready.

YouShouldKnow,9c2lf9,YSK how to guard against common misconceptions about sexual consent,"It's important to understand sexual consent because [sexual activity without consent is sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault). Before you flip out about how ""everyone knows what consent is,"" that is absolutely not correct! [Some](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/1414/6117/4323/Consent_Survey.pdf) (in fact, [many](https://globalnews.ca/news/2208421/getconsent-two-thirds-of-canadians-dont-fully-understand-sexual-consent/)) people are legit confused about what constitutes consent, such as [this teenager](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) who admitted he would ass-rape a girl because he learned from porn that girls like anal sex (overwhelmingly [not true](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181198)), or [this ostensibly well-meaning college kid](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/1/24/16925444/aziz-ansari-me-too-feminism-consent) who put his friend at STI risk after assuming she was just vying for a relationship when she said no, or [this guy](https://jezebel.com/5929544/rapists-explain-themselves-on-reddit-and-we-should-listen) from the ""ask a rapist thread"" who couldn't understand why a sex-positive girl would not have sex with him, or [this guy](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/david-silverman-atheist-fired-sexual-misconduct?utm_term=.bw0Z2VwVA6#.ton7q0E0dr) who seemed to think that because a woman was a submissive that meant he could dominate her, or [this 'comedian'](https://jezebel.com/5834712/is-this-comedy-monologue-a-rape-confession) who haplessly made a public rape confession in the form of a comedy monologue. In fact, researchers have found that in acquaintance rape--which is one of the most common types of rape--[perpetrators tend to see their behavior as seduction, not rape, or they somehow believe the rape justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape).  


Yet [sexual assault is a tractable problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4660251/). More of us being wise [can help bring justice to victims of sexual violence](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a11f/cc161e2f008497a74ae4c3ae9cd72e17fd3a.pdf). And yes, a little knowledge [can actually reduce the incidence of sexual violence](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/SV-Prevention-Technical-Package.pdf).  

The following are common misconceptions about sexual consent:

* **[An overwhelming majority of people require *explicit*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20620316.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35795183e914dfef5bad76292e6e685f) (i.e. [unambiguous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/explicit)) consent for any sexual activity beyond kissing in a new relationship**. However, [even an unwanted kiss can be fatal if the person being advanced upon feels unsafe due to a large discrepancy in size/strength](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gay-panic-austin-james-miller-texas-man-cleared-murder-a8327261.html).   

* [**""Token resistance"" to sex is virtually nonexistent, particularly for first encounters**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1998.tb00167.x). The overwhelming majority of men and women who say no to sexual advances really do mean no. It's **never** reasonable to assume that when someone says no, they don't really mean it (unless you have previously mutually agreed to role-play and have decided on an alternative safe word, in which case it's not an assumption) [even if the person has sent extremely ""mixed signals,""](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260517699948) or even [engaged in some sexual contact](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent) ([as many sexual offenses often entail](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484276/)).

* [As in other social interactions, **sexual rejections typically are communicated with softened language**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957926599010003002) (""Next time,"" ""Let's just chill,"" ""I really like you, but..."") [**and often don't even include the word ""no.""**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957926599010003002) These rejections [are still rejections](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9), and any subsequent sexual activity [is still sexual assault](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Nebraska&amp;group=9). Both men and women [are capable of understanding these types of refusals, and to pretend otherwise is disengenuous](https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/mythcommunication-its-not-that-they-dont-understand-they-just-dont-like-the-answer/). Perpetrators often [misrepresent their own actions to garnish support, avoid responsibility, blame the victim, and conceal their activities](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957926504045031), and [re-labeling sexual assault or rape as a ""miscommunication"" accomplishes those goals](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.360.5138&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). It may not be a good idea to recommend to someone that they try to communicate more forcefully, because [like domestic abusers, rapists often feel provoked by blows to their self-esteem](http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/papers/baumeistersmartboden1996[1].pdf), so encouraging someone to communicate in ways [that are considered rude](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/KITZINGER_FRITH_Just_Say_No.pdf) could actually lead them to danger. Sex offenders are [more likely to be physically violent](http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/134851.pdf), and [1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men has experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/infographic.html), so it is far from outrageous to take precautions against physical violence by being polite. 

* **[Most young women expect words to be involved](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322) when their partner seeks their consent**. [43% of young men actually ask for verbal confirmation of consent](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/masculinity-survey/masculinity-survey.csv). Overall, verbal indicators of consent or nonconsent [are more common than nonverbal indicators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). More open communication also [increases the likelihood of orgasm for women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087699/).  

* [**Consent is not synonymous with desire**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-013-0225-7). For one, there are common misconceptions that [an erect penis](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1097184x08322632) or [erect nipples](https://my3.my.umbc.edu/groups/archive/discussions/8342) necessarily signify sexual arousal. It's also possible for someone to be aroused [and still not want to have sex](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20620289.pdf?casa_token=A6WLuaSUlO0AAAAA:X8qnOoj-elReye_Y4UDM7OI2URjliYnOtHyEvwY95_3dYK48nqebSK_NiXAz8vUvgHxDjqF3Uro4ER-jzUFu7vtNjeKJW-ZfPDs5LY14zufSl2goP2Ve). Women [often have a physiological sexual response to sexual stimuli that is independent of desire, and that may serve a protective effect against injury from unwanted sex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811244/).  Misperception of sexual interest [may increase risk of sexually coercive or aggressive behavior](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/sites/psychology.uiowa.edu/files/groups/treat/files/Treat%20et%20al_,%202016.pdf), and [studies consistently show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Consent) men perceive women's actions to be more sexual than the woman intends ([93% have misperceived sexual interest on at least one occassion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/), though [most correct their understanding *before* engaging in nonconsensual sexual contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455931/)). Men who date women are less likely to accurately label sexual assault [when the victim's interest is even a little ambiguous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294695). If the victim has an [orgasm, that does not retroactively mean the sex was agreed to](https://sapac.umich.edu/article/52). Relatedly, one of the most common reasons [women fake orgasms is to end unwanted sexual encounters](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363460716649338?journalCode=sexa). Sex with an aroused person who [hasn't consented is still sexual assault](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault).  

* [**Consenting to engage in some sexual activity does not imply consent for further sexual activity**](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent). The kinds of sexual behaviors one finds appealing is [highly individualistic](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181198). The law is clear that [one may consent to one form of sexual contact without providing blanket future consent to all sexual contact](https://journals.cdrs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/Brodsky_Final_PRINT.pdf), yet most sexual assaults [happen during a hookup when a man forces a higher level of sexual intimacy than the woman consented to](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.3316&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). Most women [do not achieve orgasm during one-night stands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5325674/), and are [less likely to want to engage in intercourse as part of a hookup](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3262661/). 

* [**Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent**](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape), [nor does the law require evidence of injury](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php) in order for consent to be deemed absent. Women who try to physically resist rapes [are more likely to end up physically injured, while those who try to argue or reason with the offender are less likely to be injured](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1015254631767.pdf). The increased probability of injury [may be small, but the consequences serious](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.8460&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf).

* **[Consent](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Vermont&amp;group=9) can be [legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=District%20of%20Columbia&amp;group=9) communicated [verbally or nonverbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9), and [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&amp;group=9) be [specific to engage in the sexual activity in question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_rape#Canada)**. Behaviors which don't meet the bar for communicating explicit consent for a particular sexual behavior (like [accepting an alcoholic beverage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072826), [going to a date's room](https://prevent.richmond.edu/prevention/education/rape-myths.html), [kissing](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent), or [getting undressed](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1013.758&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)) are at best indicators of [likelihood for future consent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X17308571).

* **[Nonconsent can legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Nebraska&amp;group=9) be communicated [verbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20York&amp;group=9) or by [pulling away](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Hawaii&amp;group=9) or [other](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&amp;group=9) nonverbal [conduct](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9)**.   

* **[Submitting to sex](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Florida&amp;group=9) is [not legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Delaware&amp;group=9) the [same as consenting to sex](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/cases/R-v-Olugboja.php)**. [Some sex offenders kill their victims to avoid getting caught](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235213000470); [victims often become compliant during an assault as a protective measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological). 

* **[It's possible](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Maryland&amp;group=9) for someone to be [too intoxicated](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Louisiana&amp;group=9) to [give valid consent](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=South%20Dakota&amp;group=9)**. Contrary to popular belief, [alcohol is not an aphrodisiac.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650) (in fact, [sober sex tends to be more wanted and enjoyable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650)). [Most college sexual assaults occur when the victim is incapacitated due to intoxication or sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294944). Deliberately getting a victim too drunk to resist [is a tactic used by some perpetrators to commit sexual assault or rape](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1125&amp;context=psychfacpub). If someone is blackout drunk, it's a good idea to assume [they cannot consent](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/coerced-consent-yes-means-no/all/1/) to sex. [Here are some easy ways to tell if a person is blackout drunk](http://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/StudentServices/StudentSuccess/How_to_Test_for_Blackouts.pdf).  

* **[Intoxication is not](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&amp;group=9) a [legally defensible excuse for failure to get consent](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php)**.

Intoxicated men who are attracted to a woman are particularly likely to [focus their attention on signs of sexual interest and miss or discount signs of disinterest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/). Intoxicated predators will also often [pick out victims they know to be impaired by drugs or (usually) alcohol and make them have sex even when they know them to be unwilling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455931/), while maintaining their own sobriety enough to remember that sex their victim was too drunk for was actually unwilling. If intoxication were a legally defensible excuse, rapists would just have to drink heavily (or claim they were drinking heavily) to get away with rape. 

* [**Wearing someone down by repeatedly asking for sex until they ""consent"" to sex is a form of coercion**. Some forms of coercion are also illegal in some jurisdictions](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf). Genuine consent [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Wisconsin&amp;group=9) be [freely given](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&amp;group=9).

* [**Silence is not consent**](https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault). [Fighting, fleeing, and **freezing**](https://cmhc.utexas.edu/stressrecess/Level_One/fof.html) are common fear responses, and thus not signs of consent. In fact, [most rape victims freeze in fear in response to unwanted sexual contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological), even though [most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape). 

* **[It is necessary to obtain consent from men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322)**, too, as [men are not in a constant state of agreement to sex](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1097184X08322632). 

* **Consent must happen *before* sexual contact is made**, or a violation has already occurred. [Legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&amp;group=9), sexual contact that takes a person [by surprise](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20Hampshire&amp;group=9) deprives them [of the opportunity](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Rhode%20Island&amp;group=9) to [communicate nonconsent](https://www.rainn.org/laws-your-state-montana). There is [often a long period of uncertainty described in victim's rape accounts where she felt shocked by the rapist’s behavior and unsure of what was transpiring](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9963&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). In fact, [most unwanted fondling, and many rapes, occur because the victim didn't have time to stop it before it happened](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.3316&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). Most victims also [become compliant during an assault, which is a protective behavior that does not signify consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological). 

* **Consent is [ethically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-consensual_condom_removal#Legal_and_ethical_concerns) (and *[arguably](http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sc-stealthing-condom-removal-family-0427-20170427-story.html)* or [definitely](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-stealthing/swiss-court-upholds-sentence-in-stealthing-condom-case-idUSKBN1851UN) legally) required before removing a condom**. [STIs are on the rise](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/health/std-rates-united-states-2018-bn/index.html), many people are [unaware they have an STI they can transmit to a partner, there is an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea on the rise that could literally be fatal](https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg/default.htm), there is [no reliable HPV test for men](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/hpvandmen-fact-sheet-february-2012.pdf), and [herpes might lead to Alzheimer's](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/21/621908340/researchers-find-herpes-viruses-in-brains-marked-by-alzheimers-disease). It's simply intolerable in a civilized society to knowingly expose someone to those risks without their knowledge or consent. 

* [**The NISVS includes using lies or false promises to obtain sex in their definition of sexual coercion**](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf). 

* [**Consent is at least as important (and just as required) in BDSM relationships**](http://www.nspb.net/index.php/nspb/article/view/180). It's true that [sexual fantasies involving dominance and/or submissions are somewhat common](http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Joyal-et-al.-2014-What-Exactly-Is-an-Unusual-Sexual-Fantasy.pdf); however, even 'rape fantasies' (which would more accurately be called ""ravishment play,"" snce [no one *actually* wants to get raped](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498609551298)) must be carried out [within the context of mutually agreed-upon terms](http://www.nspb.net/index.php/nspb/article/view/180). It's never reasonable to assume that a particular person A) wants to be dominated B) by a particular person C) at a particular time. Sexually dominating a kinky person who hasn't consented is still sexual assault. 

* ***Affirmative consent* is generally required on college campuses, (and a growing number of legal jurisdictions)**. For examples, have a look at [Yale's sexual misconduct examples](https://smr.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual-Misconduct-Scenarios.pdf), [Purdue's consent policy](http://www.purdue.edu/policies/ethics/iiic1.html), [Illinois'](https://www.ethics.uillinois.edu/training/sexual_misconduct_training/employee_training_definitions/uic), [Michigan's](https://sapac.umich.edu/article/49), [Harvard's](https://osapr.harvard.edu/creating-culture-consent), [Stanford's](https://sara.stanford.edu/resources/consent), [Wisconsin's](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/prevention/violence-prevention/sexual-assault/), [Minnesota's](https://policy.umn.edu/hr/sexharassassault), [Wyoming's](http://www.uwyo.edu/stop/get-educated/sexual-assault/definingconsent.html), [Indiana's](https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/oasis/education/justsayknow/know-consent.shtml), or [Arkansas'](https://provost.uark.edu/faculty-handbook/5-employment-records-sexual-assault-harrassment/04.php) university policies on sexual consent (or [California's](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=California&amp;group=9), [Canada's](http://www.leaf.ca/the-law-of-consent-in-sexual-assault/), [Spain's](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/18/spain-to-introduce-yes-means-yes-sexual-consent-law), [Sweden's](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-05-26/swedens-new-law-affirmative-consent-hailed-questions-remain), etc.). A requirement for affirmative permission [reflects the contract-like nature of the sexual agreement; the partners must actively negotiate to change the conditions of a joint enterprise, rather than proceed unilaterally until they meet resistance.](https://journals.cdrs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/Brodsky_Final_PRINT.pdf) Logically, it makes much more sense for a person who wishes to engage in sexual activity to get explicit permission for the particular sexaul activity they would like to engage in, rather than the receiving party having to preemptively say ""no"" to the endless list of possible sexual acts.

If all of this seems obvious, ask yourself how many of these key points were missed in popular analyses of [this viral news article](https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355).

Anyone can be the victim of sexual violence, and anyone can be a perpetrator. Most of the research focuses on male perpetrators with female victims, because [that is by far the most common](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/04da/797e90eed97fabcfc24d769e0397eddd0c9d.pdf), making it both the easiest to study and the most impactful to understand. If you think you may have been victimized by sexual violence, YSK there are free resources available to you whether you are in the [U.S.](https://www.rainn.org/after-sexual-assault), [Canada](https://crcvc.ca/for-victims/services/), [UK](https://rapecrisis.org.uk/), [Australia](http://www.rape-dvservices.org.au/), [Ireland](http://www.cosc.ie/EN/COSC/NS/Sexual%20Violence%20Services%20for%20Women%20and%20Men), [Scotland](https://www.rapecrisisscotland.org.uk/), [New Zealand](http://toah-nnest.org.nz/), etc. Rape Crisis Centers can provide victims of rape and sexual assault with an Advocate (generally for free) to help navigate the legal and medical system. [Survivors of sexual violence who utilize an Advocate are significantly less likely to experience secondary victimization and find their contact with the system less stressful](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38d2/cc8df92f64acb9141d6d8ef0d79d0ce2fe15.pdf).",1535803854,"how to guard against common misconceptions about sexual consent It's important to understand sexual consent because [sexual activity without consent is sexual assault]( Before you flip out about how ""everyone knows what consent is,"" that is absolutely not correct! [Some]( (in fact, [many]( people are legit confused about what constitutes consent, such as [this teenager](;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) who admitted he would ass-rape a girl because he learned from porn that girls like anal sex (overwhelmingly [not true](, or [this ostensibly well-meaning college kid]( who put his friend at STI risk after assuming she was just vying for a relationship when she said no, or [this guy]( from the ""ask a rapist thread"" who couldn't understand why a sex-positive girl would not have sex with him, or [this guy]( who seemed to think that because a woman was a submissive that meant he could dominate her, or [this 'comedian']( who haplessly made a public rape confession in the form of a comedy monologue. In fact, researchers have found that in acquaintance rape--which is one of the most common types of rape--[perpetrators tend to see their behavior as seduction, not rape, or they somehow believe the rape justified](  


Yet [sexual assault is a tractable problem]( More of us being wise [can help bring justice to victims of sexual violence]( And yes, a little knowledge [can actually reduce the incidence of sexual violence](  

The following are common misconceptions about sexual consent:

* **[An overwhelming majority of people require *explicit*]( (i.e. [unambiguous]( consent for any sexual activity beyond kissing in a new relationship**. However, [even an unwanted kiss can be fatal if the person being advanced upon feels unsafe due to a large discrepancy in size/strength](   

* [**""Token resistance"" to sex is virtually nonexistent, particularly for first encounters**]( The overwhelming majority of men and women who say no to sexual advances really do mean no. It's **never** reasonable to assume that when someone says no, they don't really mean it (unless you have previously mutually agreed to role-play and have decided on an alternative safe word, in which case it's not an assumption) [even if the person has sent extremely ""mixed signals,""]( or even [engaged in some sexual contact]( ([as many sexual offenses often entail](

* [As in other social interactions, **sexual rejections typically are communicated with softened language**]( (""Next time,"" ""Let's just chill,"" ""I really like you, but..."") [**and often don't even include the word ""no.""**]( These rejections [are still rejections](;group=9), and any subsequent sexual activity [is still sexual assault](;group=9). Both men and women [are capable of understanding these types of refusals, and to pretend otherwise is disengenuous]( Perpetrators often [misrepresent their own actions to garnish support, avoid responsibility, blame the victim, and conceal their activities](, and [re-labeling sexual assault or rape as a ""miscommunication"" accomplishes those goals](;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). It may not be a good idea to recommend to someone that they try to communicate more forcefully, because [like domestic abusers, rapists often feel provoked by blows to their self-esteem]([1].pdf), so encouraging someone to communicate in ways [that are considered rude]( could actually lead them to danger. Sex offenders are [more likely to be physically violent](, and [1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men has experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner](, so it is far from outrageous to take precautions against physical violence by being polite. 

* **[Most young women expect words to be involved]( when their partner seeks their consent**. [43% of young men actually ask for verbal confirmation of consent]( Overall, verbal indicators of consent or nonconsent [are more common than nonverbal indicators]( More open communication also [increases the likelihood of orgasm for women](  

* [**Consent is not synonymous with desire**]( For one, there are common misconceptions that [an erect penis]( or [erect nipples]( necessarily signify sexual arousal. It's also possible for someone to be aroused [and still not want to have sex]( Women [often have a physiological sexual response to sexual stimuli that is independent of desire, and that may serve a protective effect against injury from unwanted sex](  Misperception of sexual interest [may increase risk of sexually coercive or aggressive behavior](,%202016.pdf), and [studies consistently show]( men perceive women's actions to be more sexual than the woman intends ([93% have misperceived sexual interest on at least one occassion](, though [most correct their understanding *before* engaging in nonconsensual sexual contact]( Men who date women are less likely to accurately label sexual assault [when the victim's interest is even a little ambiguous]( If the victim has an [orgasm, that does not retroactively mean the sex was agreed to]( Relatedly, one of the most common reasons [women fake orgasms is to end unwanted sexual encounters]( Sex with an aroused person who [hasn't consented is still sexual assault](  

* [**Consenting to engage in some sexual activity does not imply consent for further sexual activity**]( The kinds of sexual behaviors one finds appealing is [highly individualistic]( The law is clear that [one may consent to one form of sexual contact without providing blanket future consent to all sexual contact](, yet most sexual assaults [happen during a hookup when a man forces a higher level of sexual intimacy than the woman consented to](;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). Most women [do not achieve orgasm during one-night stands](, and are [less likely to want to engage in intercourse as part of a hookup]( 

* [**Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent**](, [nor does the law require evidence of injury]( in order for consent to be deemed absent. Women who try to physically resist rapes [are more likely to end up physically injured, while those who try to argue or reason with the offender are less likely to be injured]( The increased probability of injury [may be small, but the consequences serious](;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf).

* **[Consent](;group=9) can be [legally](;group=9) communicated [verbally or nonverbally](;group=9), and [must](;group=9) be [specific to engage in the sexual activity in question](**. Behaviors which don't meet the bar for communicating explicit consent for a particular sexual behavior (like [accepting an alcoholic beverage](, [going to a date's room](, [kissing](, or [getting undressed](;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)) are at best indicators of [likelihood for future consent](

* **[Nonconsent can legally](;group=9) be communicated [verbally](;group=9) or by [pulling away](;group=9) or [other](;group=9) nonverbal [conduct](;group=9)**.   

* **[Submitting to sex](;group=9) is [not legally](;group=9) the [same as consenting to sex](**. [Some sex offenders kill their victims to avoid getting caught](; [victims often become compliant during an assault as a protective measure]( 

* **[It's possible](;group=9) for someone to be [too intoxicated](;group=9) to [give valid consent](;group=9)**. Contrary to popular belief, [alcohol is not an aphrodisiac.]( (in fact, [sober sex tends to be more wanted and enjoyable]( [Most college sexual assaults occur when the victim is incapacitated due to intoxication or sleep]( Deliberately getting a victim too drunk to resist [is a tactic used by some perpetrators to commit sexual assault or rape](;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1125&amp;context=psychfacpub). If someone is blackout drunk, it's a good idea to assume [they cannot consent]( to sex. [Here are some easy ways to tell if a person is blackout drunk](  

* **[Intoxication is not](;group=9) a [legally defensible excuse for failure to get consent](**.  Heavy alcohol consumption [increases the risk of sexual offending]( in [certain high-risk men]( Intoxicated men who are attracted to a woman are particularly likely to [focus their attention on signs of sexual interest and miss or discount signs of disinterest]( Intoxicated predators will also often [pick out victims they know to be impaired by drugs or (usually) alcohol and make them have sex even when they know them to be unwilling](, while maintaining their own sobriety enough to remember that sex their victim was too drunk for was actually unwilling.

YouShouldKnow,9apdcv,YSK how to book your first therapy/psychologist appointment,"YSK how to find help from a professional if you're in need or have been considering it. It can seem intimidating, which is the last thing someone needing help wants to deal with. These steps assume you have medical insurance, maybe others can chime in for those that don't. 

From my experience, I usually

1) first go to https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists and filter local therapists by whether they accept your insurance, issue, and whatever else is important to you (sex, therapy style, LGBTQ focused, etc).

2) Once you find a list, I would then go to your insurance site and you'll be able to find a directory of covered therapists. Even though the therapist listed the insurance on Psychology Today, that might be outdated info or inaccurate or whatever. So cross reference the list of therapists you picked out from Psychology Today with the insurance company's list.

3) Of those that appear to accept your insurance, start reaching out to some from their Psychology Today profile. Many you can email straight from that profile page. Others you will need to call. I generally use a message like this:

""Good afternoon, my name is X. I am interested in learning how to go about setting up an initial appointment with you. I have been previously diagnosed with X **or** I have trouble dealing with X and believe it might be X. I have X insurance, which it appears you accept. If accepting new patients, please just let me know next steps. Thanks!""

If calling, the same bit can be used.

4) They'll then let you know if they are accepting new patients and if they accept your insurance, and (if so) then set up an initial appointment with you (or sometimes an initial call). Be aware that lots of therapists have full patient loads and not accepting patients (you can ask about a wait list) and many don't accept insurance (way too much paperwork on their part). Don't give up! You'll probably have to reach out to multiple before you get one that can see you and then after the initial appointment (which is basically a meet and greet), you decide whether you feel comfortable talking with this person or if you want to try another.

YouShouldKnow,99u1jl,"YSK that a red line moving towards the center of your body from an insect bite, scratch or any skin related wound, is a sign of a serious infection. Go see a doctor!","Throughout my life, I have been very prone to the infamous red line that was seen on the front page today. I've had at least 9 of them... some very serious, some not so much. 

The red line is a form of Lymphangitis. This is a bacterial infection that spreads up the lymph channels. Gives a red line that goes up the arm or leg. More serious because the infection can get into the bloodstream. (This is called sepsis.)

What I do to prevent the line from forming:
1). DO NOT ITCH IT. Itching the wound or bite increases the odds of bacteria entering the afflicted spot.
2). Put triple antibiotic cream on the affected area. This helps reduce the amount of bacteria capable of entering the afflicted area. If the line does not go away after a day, go to the doctor or hospital to get it checked out!

The first time this happened to me, the line made it from my foot to my groin and I could not move my leg. The doctors gave me an extremely painful shot and mentioned that it could've killed me had it made it past my lymphnodes in my groin!

Watch your bug bites people!

YouShouldKnow,9824t5,YSK this hack to easily save 5-10% on all your Uber/Lyft rides,"Rideshare driver here. I'm gonna share a well-kept secret with you all if you promise not to abuse it. This hack revolves around Uber and Lyft's upfront pricing scheme. **Skip the next few paragraphs if you don't want the long-winded explanation.**

---

You see, back in the day when you requested an Uber/Lyft, a driver would show up and you would tell them where you want to go or even just give them turn by turn directions. After reaching the destination, the passenger was charged a rate based on time and mileage driven and multiplied by a ""surge"" rate depending on demand. Then Uber took a 20% cut of that fare and the rest went to the driver. Pretty simple system.

The problem is that if the driver accidentally misses a turn or purposely takes a long route then the passenger is on the hook for those miles and minutes, so you could never really depend on your ride to be a reliable, predictable price or if you'll even be able to afford it by the time it's all added up. And since drivers are independent contractors and not employees, Uber/Lyft aren't allowed to tell them they have to take the passenger down a particular route or do it under a time limit.

So Uber and Lyft implemented upfront pricing. Using live traffic data and their algorithmic wizardry, they estimate the trip's time and mileage beforehand to calculate an upfront fare and that's what you as the passenger pay. Problems solved! Brilliant, right?

Well, that's where they got greedy.

You see, estimates aren't always correct; conditions can change en route causing the prepaid amount to be too low and forcing Uber/Lyft take a loss. Even if there's no traffic, the driver might have the option to go directly there on surface streets and arrive in 20 minutes or drive three times more distance on the highway and but get there 5 minutes sooner, producing wildly different fares in each scenario. To cover all these situations without the possibility of a loss, Uber/Lyft have decided to *always* charge *every* passenger for the longest possible route that the driver could conceivably choose, plus an extra amount as a buffer in case there are unexpected delays.

Bottom line is that under this upfront pricing system, you are getting slightly screwed on every ride to make sure that Uber and Lyft come out ahead on the transaction.

---

**So what's the hack?** How do you get around the upfront prices and revert to the old system of just paying by the mile/minute that's actually driven instead of paying for the longest possible route?

##Pretty simple really. Just change your destination from a shorter trip to a longer trip after your ride is quoted! Obviously Uber/Lyft will recalculate the fare when you get there since it will be higher than the smaller upfront price you were quoted. When they recalculate it at the end of the ride, it will be done based on the actual route taken :) cheers!

As to the ""not abusing it"" part, just don't make things harder for us drivers. We somewhat rely on the destinations you enter when you request the ride to be accurate so that our ""destination filter"" will work properly to sort out rides going in the direction that we're trying to go. So when you put in the fake shorter destination, make sure it's in the same general direction you want to go and maybe 70-80% of the way there so we won't be too far away from our own target destination once we finish taking you to your actual further destination. Also, try to save this trick to use on longer rides like $20-$30+ so it will actually save you a buck or two. It'll only save you a few cents on a shorter $5 ride so it's probably not worth the hassle on those.

Hopefully my explanation wasn't too convoluted. Enjoy your savings, fellow redditors!

#TLDR; When initially inputting your destination into the Uber or Lyft app, enter an address that's about 70% of the way towards where you actually want to go. Then once you're quoted a price and assigned a driver, use the app to change your destination to where you actually want to go. When you get there, the price you were quoted will be recalculated and will be slightly higher, but it will be a few bucks lower than you would have paid if you put in your actual destination initially to generate the price quote. This works because Uber and Lyft have been slightly cheating you on upfront pricing all this time.",1534511422,"this hack to easily save 5-10% on all your Uber/Lyft rides Rideshare driver here.

It's cool to hear about all the behind the scenes stuff, and I thought you should know about this in case you're a big fan of the movie or just like film in general.

* In Pineapple Express, me and my co-writer Evan had to roll all the cross joints needed to film (about 100) ourselves because nobody else on the crew could roll them properly.

* The name Pineapple Express was around for years before the movie. It’s a Hawaiian weather system that sometimes hits the Pacific Northwest, which is where we’re from. Evan heard the name and said “that would be a great name for a movie.” Years later we found a perfect fit.
* There was NO strain of weed called Pineapple Express when we made the movie. We said “if one day, people are out there selling weed called Pineapple Express, it worked”.
* Throughout the fight scene in Red’s house in Pineapple Express, I broke my finger and Danny McBride got his head cracked open when Franco hit him with the bong.
* The reason Saul wears a headband in Pineapple Express is the result of another injury. There’s a shot (that’s in the movie) when we are running through the woods, Franco hits his head on a tree. He actually hit his head on a screw that was holding a pad in place and got stitches.
* Red refers to his ex-wife having gotten out of jail recently. There’s a pic of Red and his ex wife, who was played by Stormy Daniels.
* We wrote Pineapple Express express for me to play Saul and Franco to play Dale. James wanted to switch roles, and I didn’t care that much, so we did.
* The shots of the dick drawings on the principals desk in Superbad was actually filmed on the set of Pineapple Express in the woods while we were shooting Dale and Saul destroying their cell phones.
* Red was originally supposed to die the first time he was shot when he was tied up in his apartment, but we thought Danny Mcbride was so funny that we just kept bringing him back to life.
*  While we were filming the scene where Red is taped to the chair in Pineapple Express, Danny had to actually be taped in the chair all day and we couldn’t let him out because it took too long to put him back.

* I did my 99% of my own stunts

YouShouldKnow,93rku0,"YSK that doing tons of sit ups won't give you a slimmer waist. Instead, improve your diet and incorporate lower body weight lifting to reduce your waist to hip ratio","I see a lot of women in the gym who do entire workouts training just abs with the hope of attaining an hourglass figure. Ladies, if your goal is to reduce you waist, spending hours doing sit ups is not the best training method.

When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. So when you do heavy strength training exercises to target your abs, you're encouraging these muscles to grow bigger. The result of all those weighted side planks and other exercises designed to ""tone"" your stomach aren't working way you think. They are ""toning"" those muscles by causing them to grow bigger, which in turn causes your waist to thicken.

If your goal is to reduce your waist to hip ratio, you would be better off dedicating more of your exercise time to building muscles in your lower body, plus improving your diet to reduce your overall body fat. Lower body lifts will give you a stronger, curvier butt (i.e. add inches to your hips), and improved diet will help to reduce your overall body fat (i.e. remove inches from your waist). The result? A more hourglass figure. The Mayo Clinic gives a good, more scientific [explanation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/belly-fat/art-20045809).

YouShouldKnow,92affy,YSK Attorney Client privilege only exists if the lawyer is representing the client for a specific incident,"Hey Reddit

There's been a lot of discussion on here and various social media and news platforms recently about a particular investigation and how a lawyer disclosing information about meetings with their client may be going against attorney-client privilege (a lawyer should not disclose information that their client has provided them in a court) .

Many are calling for the lawyer to be disbarred.

However, for a attorney-client privilege to exist, the lawyer has to be representing to client for a specific incident (murder, robbery, adultery etc.).

The lawyer cannot operate as a lawyer for all crimes. 

As the client has publically denied relations and paying off an individual, and has said his lawyer does not represent him in the case of payments made to said individual, attorney-client privilege does NOT exist in that circumstance, meaning the lawyer is free to provide information to the investigation.

YouShouldKnow,90gxlj,"YSK that if you use certain drugs to medicate your dog/cat for storm and firework anxiety, they are completely aware of whatever is terrifying them but are unable to move, which is why their anxiety gets worse over time, because they remember everything.","Acepromazine, or ""Ace"" as it's often referred to, is a very common pre-anesthetic drug often given to take home in tablet form for dogs that have storm anxiety or experience trauma with fireworks or grooming. Some vets prescribe it for aggressive animals to be given before appointments so they are more manageable by the veterinary staff. 

This is an older drug, but it's still very prevalent in the veterinary field today, and is used per the discretion and preference of the DVM. 

When used *in combination* with other drugs (such as diazepam, which is truly an anxiolytic, or ketamine, a catatonic anesthetic), it causes great relaxation and those drugs help make the animal mentally relaxed. In these situations it's totally humane, useful, and responsible. 

When given by itself, the dog or cat is locked inside its own brain. Recent studies have monitored brain activity and revealed that dogs undergoing traumatic events on acepromazine were completely aware of their surroundings, including noises and being touched. They were still terrified, but their motor skills were reduced and therefore they visually seem to be relaxed. 

This explains why people often see their pet's anxiety with storms get worse and worse over time; the dogs know when a storm is coming, and they know every time it happens that they're suddenly not in control of their bodies and can't do anything but lay there in horror. If it were me, I'd get more anxious and/or aggressive over time too! 

Some vets have moved on to better, newer products to help ease anxiety, but there's still plenty of vets that use this as the gold standard. 

If you have to medicate your pet for severe situational anxiety, check and make sure this isn't the drug you're using. It may make your pet relaxed, but they're suffering in silence on the inside. There are all sorts of new medications and solutions to help keep your pet calm, safe, and comforted.

YouShouldKnow,8zf70r,"YSK about the 3-2-1 rule for backing up important data - 3 copies, 2 different mediums/devices and 1 offsite.","Most people only think about data backups when their hard drive crashes and it's too late.

The 3-2-1 rule is the best strategy for backing up important data for the average user.

The idea is that you should have at least 3 copies of your data, on at least 2 different mediums locally and 1 offsite. A common example is having the file on your computer, backed up onto an external hard drive/NAS (Network Attached Storage) and backed up to a cloud service like Dropbox, Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.

The reason for this strategy is that having 2 copies on different mediums locally means that there is a much lower chance of losing it all in one go. For example if you put two copies on the one computer (on two different hard drives or even folders) if that computer gets corrupted, stolen etc then you've lost it all at once. Having a second storage medium locally means that if something goes wrong with one, the other should be ok and you can quickly restore it.

The reason for having 1 offsite is for when there is a major loss, flood/fire/famine or someone robs you and takes both devices, your data is still protected elsewhere and can be restored.

The next important step is to actually automate the process, because if you rely on doing it yourself manually, then you're going to realise when your hard drive crashes that the last time you remembered to back up your data was 8 months ago and you've just lost the photos of your kids first steps or all your tax receipts.

Automation is fairly easy and there are a wide range of software solutions available, from windows built in backup/restore function to dedicated software.

Personally i use the software that came with my NAS drive and it's set to automatically backup my important data (stuff i don't want to lose) once a week. For critical data (stuff that i absolutely cannot lose), i then have that backed up to a cloud drive once a week also.

YouShouldKnow,8x15mt,YSK common misconceptions about sexual consent,"It's important to understand sexual consent because [sexual activity without consent is sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault). Before you flip out about how ""everyone knows what consent is,"" that is absolutely not correct! Some (in fact, [many](https://globalnews.ca/news/2208421/getconsent-two-thirds-of-canadians-dont-fully-understand-sexual-consent/)) people are legit confused about what constitutes consent, such as [this teenager who admitted he would ass-rape a girl because he learned from porn that girls like anal sex](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news), or [this ostensibly well-meaning college kid who put his friend at STI risk after assuming she was just vying for a relationship when she said no](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/1/24/16925444/aziz-ansari-me-too-feminism-consent), or [this guy from the ""ask a rapist thread"" who couldn't understand why a sex-positive girl would not have sex with him](https://jezebel.com/5929544/rapists-explain-themselves-on-reddit-and-we-should-listen), or [this guy who haplessly made a public rape confession in the form of a comedy monologue](https://jezebel.com/5834712/is-this-comedy-monologue-a-rape-confession). In fact, [researchers have found that in aquaintance rape--which is one of the most common types of rape--perpetrators tend to see their behavior as seduction, not rape, or they somehow believe the rape justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape).  

[Misperception of sexual intent is one of the biggest predictors of sexual assault](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139770/). 

Yet [sexual assault is a tractable problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4660251/). [More of us being wise can help bring justice to victims of sexual violence](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a11f/cc161e2f008497a74ae4c3ae9cd72e17fd3a.pdf). And yes, a little knowledge [can actually reduce the incidence of sexual violence](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/SV-Prevention-Technical-Package.pdf).

* **[An overwhelming majority of people require *explicit*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20620316.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35795183e914dfef5bad76292e6e685f) (i.e. [unambiguous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/explicit)) consent for any sexual activity beyond kissing in a new relationship**. However, [even an unwanted kiss can be fatal if the person being advanced upon feels unsafe due to a large discrepancy in size/strength](https://globalnews.ca/news/4174526/gay-panic-murder-charge-lesser-sentence-austin/).   

* [**""Token resistance"" to sex is virtually nonexistent, particularly for first encounters**. The overwhelming majority of men and women who say no to sexual advances really do mean no](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1998.tb00167.x). It's **never** reasonable to assume that when someone says no, they don't really mean it (unless you have previously mutually agreed to role-play and have decided on an alternative safe word, in which case it's not an assumption) [even if the person has sent extremely ""mixed signals,""](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260517699948) or even [engaged in some sexual contact](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent) ([as many sexual offenses often entail](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484276/)).

* [As in other social interactions, **sexual rejections typically are communicated with softened language** (""Next time,"" ""Let's just chill,"" ""I really like you, but..."") **and often don't even include the word ""no.""**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957926599010003002) These [rejections are still rejections](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9), and [any subsequent sexual activity is still sexual assault](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Nebraska&amp;group=9). [Both men and women are capable of understanding these types of refusals, and to pretend otherwise is disengenuous](https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/mythcommunication-its-not-that-they-dont-understand-they-just-dont-like-the-answer/). [Perpetrators often misrepresent their own actions to garnish support, avoid responsibility, blame the victim, and conceal their activities](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957926504045031), and [re-labeling sexual assault or rape as a ""miscommunication"" accomplishes those goals](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.360.5138&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). It may not be a good idea to recommend to someone that they try to communicate more forcefully, because [like domestic abusers, rapists often feel provoked by blows to their self-esteem](http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/papers/baumeistersmartboden1996[1].pdf), so encouraging someone to [communicate in ways that are considered rude](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/KITZINGER_FRITH_Just_Say_No.pdf) could actually lead them to danger. [1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men has experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/infographic.html), so it is far from outrageous to take precautions against physical violence by being polite. 

* [**Most young women expect words to be involved when their partner seeks their consent**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). [43% of young men actually ask for verbal confirmation of consent](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/masculinity-survey/masculinity-survey.csv). Overall, [verbal indicators of consent or nonconsent are more common than nonverbal indicators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). 

* [**Consent is not synonymous with desire**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-013-0225-7). For one, there are common misconceptions that [an erect penis](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1097184x08322632) or [erect nipples](https://my3.my.umbc.edu/groups/archive/discussions/8342) necessarily signify sexual arrousal. It's also [possible for someone to be aroused and still not want to have sex](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20620289.pdf?casa_token=A6WLuaSUlO0AAAAA:X8qnOoj-elReye_Y4UDM7OI2URjliYnOtHyEvwY95_3dYK48nqebSK_NiXAz8vUvgHxDjqF3Uro4ER-jzUFu7vtNjeKJW-ZfPDs5LY14zufSl2goP2Ve). [Misperception of sexual interest may increase risk of sexually coercive or aggressive behavior](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/sites/psychology.uiowa.edu/files/groups/treat/files/Treat%20et%20al_,%202016.pdf), and [studies consistently show men perceive women's actions to be more sexual than the woman intends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Consent) ([93% have misperceived sexual interest on at least one occassion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/), though [most don't respond with sexual contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455931/)). Men who date women are [less likely to accurately label sexual assault when the victim's interest is even a little ambiguous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294695). [Sex with an aroused person who hasn't consented is still sexual assault](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault).  

* [**Consenting to engage in some sexual activity does not imply consent for further sexual activity**](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent). [The law is clear that one may consent to one form of sexual contact without providing blanket future consent to all sexual contact](https://journals.cdrs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/Brodsky_Final_PRINT.pdf), yet [most sexual assault on college campuses happens during a hookup when a man forces a higher level of sexual intimacy than the woman consented to](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.3316&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). 

* [**Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent**](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape), [nor does the law require evidence of injury in order for consent to be deemed absent](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php). [Women who try to physically resist rapes are more likley to end up physically injured, while those who try to argue or reason with the offender are less likely to be injured](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1015254631767.pdf). The increased probability of injury [may be small, but the consequences serious](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.8460&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf).

* **[Consent](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Vermont&amp;group=9) can be [legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=District%20of%20Columbia&amp;group=9) communicated [verbally or nonverbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9), and [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&amp;group=9) be [specific to engage in the sexual activity in question.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_rape#Canada)**. Behaviors which don't meet the bar fot communicating explicit consent for a particular sexual behavior (like [accepting an alcoholic beverage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072826)) are at best indicators of [likelihood for future consent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X17308571).

* **[Nonconsent can legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Nebraska&amp;group=9) be communicated [verbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20York&amp;group=9) or by [pulling away](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Hawaii&amp;group=9) or [other](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&amp;group=9) nonverbal [conduct](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9)**.   

* **[Submitting to sex](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Florida&amp;group=9) is [not legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Delaware&amp;group=9) the [same as consent to sex](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/cases/R-v-Olugboja.php)**. [Some sex offenders kill their victims to avoid getting caught](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235213000470); [victims often become compliant during an assault as a protective measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological).

There is also evidence that [intoxicated men who are attracted to a woman are particularly likely to focus their attention on signs of sexual interest and miss or discount signs of disinterest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/). [Sober sex tends to be more enjoyable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650).

Contrary to popular belief, [alcohol is not an aphrodisiac](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650)
If someone is blackout drunk, it's a good idea to assume they cannot consent to sex. [Here are some easy ways to tell if a person is blackout drunk](http://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/StudentServices/StudentSuccess/How_to_Test_for_Blackouts.pdf). [Most college sexual assaults occur when the victim is incapacitated due to intoxication or sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294944). 

* [**Wearing someone down by repeadedly asking for sex until they ""consent"" to sex is a form of coercion**.

* [**Silence is not consent**](https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault). [Fighting, fleeing, and **freezing**](https://cmhc.utexas.edu/stressrecess/Level_One/fof.html) are common fear responses, and thus not signs of consent. In fact, [most rape victims freeze in fear in response to unwanted sexual contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological), even though [most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape).

* **Consent must happen *before* sexual contact is made**, or a violation has already occurred.

YouShouldKnow,8v3x16,YSK the difference between Subtitles and Closed Captions when watching movies and videos.,"Many people get frustrated when they expect one and get the other, and it is useful to know the difference between them.

**Closed Captions (CC):** Closed Captions (as opposed to Open Captions which are embedded into the video and cannot be removed) can be turned on and off by the viewer. Captions are of particular use to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing as they include audio descriptions, which include background noises, speaker differentiation, and other relevant information translated from sound to text. Captions can also be typed live, so if you're watching a live TV program then they are Captions, not Subtitles, and they are being written by live typists as the program is happening.

**Subtitles:** Subtitles assume that the viewer can hear and are typically used when the viewer doesn’t speak the language in the video. For example, movies include subtitles in the language spoken in countries where the film is distributed. Subtitles only include dialogue, as they assume that the viewer can hear the other sounds and changes in voices. Subtitles are usually written ahead of time, as they often need to be translated into different languages.

Hope this is useful!

P.S. If you see captions or subtitles that say ""\[speaks foreign language\],"" then the video writer intentionally left out translations of the language because they felt that it wasn't necessary to include the translations, or they did not want you to understand the translations, and it is *not* poor design.",1530383723,"the difference between Subtitles and Closed Captions when watching movies and videos.

YouShouldKnow,8uvinr,YSK an easy way to estimate the fuel efficiency (mpg) of your vehicle,"It's a good idea to monitor your fuel efficiency in case it drops because of some problem with the engine/exhaust/etc., or if you want to sell it.

Some newer cars estimate mpg automatically but if your have an older car, try this:

1. Fill your tank until it shuts off automatically. Get a receipt. Write your odometer reading on it. Save it.

2. Drive until you use a significant amount of fuel, like until the fuel level indicator reaches the halfway-mark, or your low-fuel light comes on. Refill to shutoff. Get a receipt that shows how many gallons of gas you bought. Write your odometer reading on it. Save it.

3. When you get home, divide the difference between odometer readings by the number of gallons shown on the **second** receipt. The quotient is your miles per gallon.

Example:

1. Fill to shutoff, odometer reading 250692.8mi.

2. Refill to shutoff, 16.542gal, odometer reading 251063.3mi.

3. 251063.3mi - 250692.8mi = 370.5mi. 370.5mi / 16.542gal = 22.4mi/gal (mpg).

YouShouldKnow,8uocjy,"YSK that in 1950, the Supreme Court ruled the ""6 percent"" real estate agents put on their contracts is ""Illegal price fixing"". You should use extreme caution and never let yourself be coerced into signing ANY contract with a percent sign on it when you can negotiate for a flat fee.","The Supreme Court case from 1950: [UNITED STATES v. REAL ESTATE BOARDS](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/339/485.html)

It's worthwhile to note that the ""6 percent"" commission grab by Realtors often equates to 4 to 6 years of equity a seller has built in their home, depending on how long they have lived in the house, and how much prices in their area have appreciated.

Do the math on how long it takes to earn that first dollar of equity.... it is fascinating.

Another way to think about this if you are a buyer using a Realtor: it'll take you 40-75+ months to pay off that Realtor's commission split as you are paying down your loan balance more slowly due to interest; you're not actually earning any equity at all.... you're simply took out a bigger loan for, and will be repaying more interest on the equity (down payment) you let the Realtors walk away from the deal with, for free. It is NOT free for a buyer to use a Realtor, no matter what they tell you.

If you decide hire someone to help you sell or buy a house, you should write the contract, not them! Unless,of course, you're hiring a lawyer who is working for a flat fee -- there are plenty of lawyers who do flat-fee contract review who are 99.999 percent better than Realtors.

1. First, open your dog's mouth and look for the object. Place one hand on the upper jaw with your thumb on one side and the rest of your finders on the other side.

2. With your other hand, push down on the lower jaw, keeping your index finger free to sweep back into the mouth. If you can see the object, remove it. If there are two of you, one of you should hold your dog's mouth open and the other look inside.

3. If that doesn't work, hold your dog upside down with his tail toward your face. Place your arms around his lower abdomen for 30 seconds while gently swaying him. 

4. If that doesn't work, place your dog on his side on a hard surface, tilted with his head down and hindquarters up. If you can grab a pillow or rolled towel, put it under his hindquarters just make sure the front part of his body is lower than his back.

5. With a small dog, place one hand on his back to steady him and the other under the center of the rib cage. Press in and up four to five times in a thrusting motion. With a large dog, you'll need both hands for the thrust, so place both hands beneath the rib cage and press in and up four or five times.

6. If you don't have time to place your dog on his side, you can stand or kneel behind your dog. Grasp his body at the bottom of his rib cage. Apply firm, quick pressure and compress the abdomen by pushing up with your fist(s). Repeat two to five times. 

7. If the dog is still choking, a sharp blow with your hand between your pet's shoulder blades might help dislodge the item.

YouShouldKnow,8d0sme,"YSK If you don't specify who to tow your car after an accident, law enforcement will call for whichever tow company responds first to get your car and they can charge daily storage fees if you don't act right away.","Cross-posted today from tifu 

You Should Know that towing fees can get out of hand after an accident if you're not prepared to tell the police where to send your car.

I learned from the googling I did after a major accident flipped my car 3 times, leaving it upside down on the side of the highway, that the system for disposing of your wreckage can be quite cold despite the trauma you've personally experienced. Everybody I dealt with that wasn't a witness or a member of my family eventually hit me up with some request for money. ""Who's your insurance? I can take your payment now. Your fee will be yada yada yada.""

I was rear ended, traveling the speed limit at 3am on an eight lane highway in little or no traffic. The person that hit my car, possibly going 90+ in a 65 area, sped off while 3 people pulled over to help me out of my car. My phone was left in the wreck, so I wasn't able to look up my information. They wouldn't let me go back to my car, so whatever insurance info I had on hand wasn't available. Nobody had the presence of mind to ask if I had AAA, which probably could have helped, so my car was towed by whatever company they contacted, if they did at all. So the 250 copay for the hospital in my insurance plan wasn't the least of my expenses that day as whomever answered the phone for the tow company fed my wife the totally untrue line that the police had to release my vehicle. $100 a day for storage with the towing fee came to about $700 or so, which they had the decency to knock off $50 in exchange for signing over the title of my wreckage to the tow company. I probably had about 30 minutes to look through my car, grabbing whatever personal items I could, before I had to leave for a follow up appointment with my doctor. Strange that the personal effects I distinctly remember seeing last on the ceiling of my car when I left it weren't there when I went to pick out my belongings at the tow company's yard, all the while an employee hovering around nearby asking me how much each item cost when I'd say ""I can't find x or y..."", while smugly smirking to himself as he watched me.

Even if you have a brush with death, there will be people there that will try to take advantage of your situation and get whatever they can from you.

I learned that tow companies will get involved without your say-so and charge exorbitant fees at a time when you are least able to make careful decisions and advocate for yourself.

I regret not putting my AAA bumper stickers on my car.

The only things what went right that day were the safety features of my car, the 3 people that didn't have to pull over and help me that day, and the ambulance crew. My hospital made me wait 3 hours before being seen for 5 minutes, the police cared more about asking my insurance carrier than who I wanted to tow my car, and the tow company hit me up with an absurd price to pay that wasn't covered in my insurance. It goes without saying the perpetrator failed me as a human being for not even stopping, I can't even claim uninsured motorist on my coverage unless the police don't find this person. I'm glad to be alive and with my family, but I feel like the system wants to make it even harder for me to survive. I currently do a physically demanding job, and I'm going to be gone for two weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if they figure out a way to get me cut loose.

YouShouldKnow,8bqvx0,YSK how to improve your posture.,"I've posted this recently on LPT and figured this sub would find this information very helpful too.

Training your posture is such an important part of an attractive appearance and good health.  Those who slouch are more at risk for back problems, and it has been proven that it has a negative effect on your mental state.

Having good posture makes you look more confident and more attractive.  It will decrease back pain, improve your mood, increase productivity, make you look taller, and many other advantages.

So here is how you can begin to work on improving how your posture is.

1.  Begin by determining the type of posture that you have.  Different types of postures need to be fixed by doing different things.  You can refer to this picture [here](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/259076_5287d522c02f4e97a8b03ff4cb5d3f8a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_630,h_354,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/259076_5287d522c02f4e97a8b03ff4cb5d3f8a~mv2.webp).  After concluding what posture you have, research what muscles you need to work on stretching and training in particular to improve it.

2.  The rest of these points will help your posture regardless of what type of posture you have.  Make sure you begin doing regular posture stretches and exercises. 
 - Chin tucks
 - Planking
 - Reverse Dumbell Flies
 - Standing Shoulder Extension Reach

3.  Make sure to do regular posture checks during your day.  When you go to drink something, train yourself to associate it with checking your posture.  Regularly checking you posture will have one of the largest impacts on your posture overall.

4.  Some easy ways to make sure you are standing straight or sitting straight are 
 - Pretend you're wearing a cape.  You'll feel your shoulders move back.
 - Check to see where your hands are when standing up straight.  If they drop in a position that has the palms facing behind you, you need to improve your standing posture.  Palms need to be parallel with the side of your body.
 - Place a stick of tape between your shoulder blades.  When they move out of position you will know.

YouShouldKnow,8a9egh,"YSK: Active Listening, a technique developed by the Samaritans to help people to talk through difficult subjects.","**Active listening may be the most important skills you ever learn.** The Samaritans (a UK-based mental health charity) developed it to talk down suicidal people, but you can use it for *any* situation where you feel like a friend needs to get something off their chest. Some friends have said that I always know how to help them, when the truth was, all they needed was to vent. I'm not a professional so please don't think of me as an expert - please consult the Samaritan's [guide] (http://www.samaritans.org/active-listening)  to their technique first and foremost.


When someone tries to open up to you, sometimes the first instinct is to be **passive**. You care about what they're saying, so you just wait for them to speak and tell you about it. For some people, that'll work. But for some people, *if you don't react they'll think you're not interested.* The other extreme is *to contribute too much.* In your panic to help, out of your mouth comes ""That's awful what are you going to do my sister's great aunt killed herself but you're better than that""
Active listening tries to find the *happy medium* between these two options.



This technique is about making someone feel important, like you want to hear what they're saying. In order to do that, here are some basics - please please if you're interested do some of your own research, as it will make you internalise the technique.


*First, use ""w"" words.* What made you think that/why did you do that/ how did that make you feel/when did you start feeling this way/ who made you feel worst.


It's their story. To encourage them to tell it to you, rephrase their statements. **Parrot.** If someone tells you ""5 years ago I was bullied constantly. Now I can't seem to move on""; there are two strands of that sentence they want to talk about. What the bullying meant for them, and why they can't seem to forget it. To tease those strands, answer with,


*""How were you bullied?""*


*""Why can't you move on?""*


Make the noises You know the ones. *Mhmm, Yes, I see*. If they're on a roll, don't slow them down by making them think you're not interested. Similarly, focus on their every word. You are their audience, you care about them so by god **you will keep eye contact even if it kills you.**


Using your best judgement, *insert your own story.* This is totally situation dependent. You will know if they want to rant or if they don't know how to express it. If they want to rant, encourage them with the handy tips above or suggested by the Samaritans' [website] (http://www.samaritans.org/active-listening) (seriously, check that thing out!). If they're afraid of how to phrase it, *use a personal story and immediately bounce it back to them.*


Think of it as tennis. If they smash the ball to you, hit it straight back. They've got the **confidence** they need. If they weakly lob it to you, send it back with your *own spin* on it. ""My brother was also bullied, he confided in me. Did you confide with anyone until now?""


*Make them think you care.* Sometimes it's a hugely emotional situation and the above tips will never be as useful as a big hug. Hugs are incredible. If you need my hugging advice, *first of all you may need help.*  But my advice would be to **hug from the shoulders not the arms,** and be comforting without being stifling.


Remember each person is different so the way you talk to people should depend on your personal knowledge of them - if you call someone a pet name, use it. If the person has a more logical turn of mind, *gingerly* steer the conversation towards what you think is a logical solution. If all they need is to vent without judgement, **do not offer advice!!**



Memorise your local suicide hotline. Trust me on this, the professionals should **always** be consulted if the person you're talking to is willing to chat to them.



*You are not a substitute for a professional.* 'Nuff said.



**DESIRE, METHOD, DATE.** If someone is suicidal, use this method to establish the threat they pose to themself. If they want to die, they know how to die, and they know when to die, *take immediate action.* Even *just one or two* of these factors could lead to someone being pushed over the edge by life events and instantly deciding to commit. 


This is important. **IF SOMEONE IS CONFIDING IN YOU NEVER DISMISS IT.** Even a joke can be a cry for help so never discount worrying information based on the *tone* it's said in.


It's a positive thing if someone wants to confide in you. They care about you enough to share a difficult part of their life. Congratulations if you are confided in, and good luck.

More lines can be found here, for your calling pleasure https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines",1523020530,"Active Listening, a technique developed by the Samaritans to help people to talk through difficult subjects. **Active listening may be the most important skills you ever learn.** The Samaritans (a UK-based mental health charity) developed it to talk down suicidal people, but you can use it for *any* situation where you feel like a friend needs to get something off their chest. Some friends have said that I always know how to help them, when the truth was, all they needed was to vent. I'm not a professional so please don't think of me as an expert - please consult the Samaritan's [guide] (  to their technique first and foremost.


When someone tries to open up to you, sometimes the first instinct is to be **passive**. You care about what they're saying, so you just wait for them to speak and tell you about it. For some people, that'll work. But for some people, *if you don't react they'll think you're not interested.* The other extreme is *to contribute too much.* In your panic to help, out of your mouth comes ""That's awful what are you going to do my sister's great aunt killed herself but you're better than that""
Active listening tries to find the *happy medium* between these two options.



This technique is about making someone feel important, like you want to hear what they're saying. In order to do that, here are some basics - please please if you're interested do some of your own research, as it will make you internalise the technique.


*First, use ""w"" words.* What made you think that/why did you do that/ how did that make you feel/when did you start feeling this way/ who made you feel worst.


It's their story. To encourage them to tell it to you, rephrase their statements. **Parrot.** If someone tells you ""5 years ago I was bullied constantly. Now I can't seem to move on""; there are two strands of that sentence they want to talk about. What the bullying meant for them, and why they can't seem to forget it. To tease those strands, answer with,


*""How were you bullied?""*


*""Why can't you move on?""*


Make the noises You know the ones. *Mhmm, Yes, I see*. If they're on a roll, don't slow them down by making them think you're not interested. Similarly, focus on their every word. You are their audience, you care about them so by god **you will keep eye contact even if it kills you.**


Using your best judgement, *insert your own story.* This is totally situation dependent. You will know if they want to rant or if they don't know how to express it.

YouShouldKnow,89zek1,"YSK ""Mail in Rebate"" is a business term for ""Scammy shit scam with extra scam on top""","I've just finally finished sorting the rebates for all my Christmas shopping, and it was the biggest pain of my life. 

Here's how you think your rebate is going to work:

1. You see a price tag: ""$300 after rebate."" Wow, only $300! What a bargain!

2. You buy that something for $400. But you've got an $100 rebate! All you have to do is fill out the form!

3. You get back $100 dollars. It's like a present from past you to future you!

Seriously, I can't bitch enough about how fucking sleazy this practice is. 

First of all, that ""extra"" $100 you feel so great about getting back? It's actually only worth like 93$. You're effectively paying sales tax twice--first on the $400 you spent to buy the damn thing, and again when you spend the $100 they send you back. 

But that's nothing compared to how hard they make it to get your rebate. It's pretty simple: the more people are too lazy/uninformed to get their rebate, the more the seller makes off like bandits. 

By design rebates are usually issued ""eight to ten weeks"" after the rebate is approved: just enough time for the average person to forget they've got a rebate coming.

Here's what you have to do to actually collect on a rebate:

1. Apply for the rebate online and then send in the bar code.
2. Eventually the status of your rebate changes to ""approved.""
3. Remember to check back in three months later and ask why your rebate hasn't arrived yet. 

But that's simple, right？ What's so hard about following up? They probably just made a simple mistake. 

Here's what happens when you call the help hotline on a rebate website. Your call is directed to one of those telephone bots, with three options:

1. To apply for a rebate, press one.
2. To check the status of a rebate, press two.(This option only tells you if it has been approved, not whether or not it has been sent.)
3. For frequently asked questions, press 3. (None of those FAQ's are ""where the fuck is my rebate”）

Again, literally every one of my rebates was the exact same procedure. If you want to talk to a *person*, you have to press zero--which isn't even one of the menu options. 

Once you do have a person, they change your status to ""sent"" and tell you to expect it in another two weeks. It's like the digital equivalent of putting the complaints &amp; returns department in a locked basement with a tiger in it. 

So, moral of the story: Save yourself a headache and only buy things that are priced honestly.

When we ask about medications we also mean those weird pills you bought over the counter for weight loss and any and all vitamins.

Edit: This is something to keep in mind for the triage process which is when you first enter a medical facility and they are trying to get your full history. And no, we don’t need to know every single time you’ve had the flu or an injection in your back, we just need to know possibly that you’ve had a history of the flu and you get frequent injections for xyz. You don’t need to get that specific with each instance unless we ask about that specific issue. 

Also since creating this post I am coming to the conclusion that 

1) there are medical professionals that do not feel the need to heed this advice and would rather move you through their facility without the proper information. This is not good medical care and it should be noted that the more I know about you the better care of you I can take. If people aren’t willing to do this either because of laziness or otherwise then they are simply doing it wrong. 

2) it has also come to my attention that some people are unwilling to give proper information to medical personnel either because they are afraid it will be used against them in life insurance terms, health insurance terms, or by the personnel themselves.  This is something I didn’t consider because I’ve never personally had this issue myself but I’ve come to realize this is most likely a real issue which ultimately affects the patient themselves. It is something to take into consideration for sure. 

3) EMTs, doctors, and nurses all work in different ways and have different objectives when they are giving care. This post is from a nurse perspective. Keep in mind if you call an ambulance they have sometimes NONE of the information that we have and so yes, you need to assume that they know nothing about you and focus on what your main problem is and the things that relate to it until you get to the hospital.

If I am specifically asking you “what is your medical history” then yes, I’m asking for the full thing. As a bedside nurse I may not ask this question. This information is simply compiled and used should we ever need it for an emergency situation or relating to some issue your having. Because you all (and myself) are not a doctor you do not know what will be important at some point.

As an American with polycystic kidney disease, and with friends and family who also have PKD, I appreciate you taking the time to learn about this widespread issue. 

I don't need a transplant yet, but right now, about 100,791 others in the US alone survive on lifespan-shortening dialysis treatments while they sit on the wait list for a kidney transplant, often waiting for years. 

Anything you can do to offer assistance to families dealing with kidney disease, kidney failure and dialysis, and anything you can do to spread awareness of this issue will be immensely appreciated and might save some lives. 

Help me spread the world about the years-long kidney transplant wait list and the kidney donor shortage, and especially the fact that a blood type mismatch doesn't have to be a dead end for someone who wants to donate a kidney to a loved one, thanks to Paired Exchange Programs.

YouShouldKnow,866ruh,YSK the difference between BCC (blind carbon copy) and CC (carbon copy) when sending emails,"I can't begin to share how many users are not aware of the difference and it makes for an awkward email/conversation later. 

Carbon copy (or courtesy copy) essentially means that you are adding recipients to an email AND that you want that info to be known by everyone in said email. This is common in emails that involve group projects, where multiple people are working together and/or to keep other people in the loop of what's happening or what has been done. 

""To"" and ""CC"" work the same way. Everyone can see everyone in these fields. 

BCC (blind carbon copy) is similar to CC, except that anyone in the ""To"" and ""CC"" fields cannot see anyone listed in the ""BCC"" field, or if anyone was even listed there. However anyone listed in the ""BCC"" field can see everyone listed in the ""To"" and ""CC"" fields. **IF** there are multiple people in the ""BCC"" field, the cannot see each other as well.

**When to use BCC**

* Usually if you're experiencing employee issues and want to keep your boss/HR involved in the paper trail, this is a fairly common method. 

* If you're sending a large group email, BCC will not reveal every email you sent this too. I have seen associates send out a company wide email and the email header would list 2000-something email addresses. 

In regards to email etiquette, the ""To"" field is usually reserved for who the email is directly for and the ""CC"" field is generally reserved for people that are the ""FYI party"". This can vary depending on work culture, etc. 


**Take the following example for instance:**

From: deutsch-technik

To: John

BCC: Amy, Kara

CC: Matt

If I sent this email, John and Matt would not see that Amy and Kara also got the email. Amy and Kara however would see everyone that was included on the email (except for each other) and the fact that only themselves were a BCC to the email. In other words, Kara would see that she was a BCC recipient on the email, but would not see that Amy was there too, and vies versa.

YouShouldKnow,8656q0,YSK: HR is about saving the company cash and may not always be looking out for your best interests,"I recently put in my 2 weeks notice with my company. We are at the end of the fiscal year, and if all goes well, we should get paid a bonus at the end of the month. When I put in my notice, I originally had my last day as the 30th of this month. My thought was that was that, since that was the last day of the work year, I would get my bonus. 

When I spoke to HR to give the notice, I made it clear I wanted to stay long enough to cash in on the bonus. Without batting an eye, they said 'fine' had me file my notice and sent me on my way. I told a co-worker friend that I was leaving on the 30th and they made it clear to me I had made a HUGE mistake. Long story short, in order to get the bonus, I had to work the ENTIRE fiscal year to START of the next one. By leaving on the 30th I would be forgoing my bonus, thus saving the company a few days and a few thousand dollars. They had no intention of informing me of my misinformation. If it wasn't for my friend being more informed on policy, I would have been out the extra cash. HR is for saving the company money, not to look out for it's 'human resources.' Luckily, I was able to postpone my resignation by a day.  That said, I will now be reviewing policies a lot more stringently going forward as I have learned a valuable lesson. 

TLDR: HR is about saving money. I almost lost thousands of dollars for not knowing policy well enough, but I was able to delay my resignation and collect my check thanks to someone better informed with a clearer consciousness than my HR rep.

TLDR ; use the damn AED without hesitation if it’s needed! "

YouShouldKnow,7v2fld,YSK what to do in case your SO has their first seizure in the middle of the night like mine did.,"Thursday morning around 3AM, my husband had his first seizure at 27. It was a tonic-clonic seizure otherwise known as a grand mal seizure. Basically the thrashing and shaking most people imagine when they think seizure. 

Luckily, I used to work for special needs students in the high school and am very familiar with the procedure on how to handle a seizure. However, it is an entirely different experience when it is your loved one in the middle of the night and I definitely made mistakes. Scary as shit. 

Seizures can be triggered by pretty much anything (food, medication, stress, etc) and according to NCBI, 8-10% of adults are at risk for a one-time seizure in theirs lifetime! You, me, anyone! And my husband’s neurologist said that the 1 in 3 people who have seizures only have them once and never again. Thus, I believe it should be common knowledge on how to handle this intimidating situation. 

1. Don’t panic!
It can be really intimidating seeing someone uncontrollably thrashing around, but stay calm! Most only last less than 2 minutes or less. 

2. Make sure they are not injuring themselves. 
Move any objects or furniture that can cause them harm if they bump into it. Put something soft under their head to protect them from a head injury. 

3. Turn them on their side. 
Very important. Turn their body or head to the side. Vomiting can occur during a seizure and if the person is on their back, they can suffocate.

4. Start timing. 
Really you should do this as soon as you see the seizure begin. You need to note how long it takes place because more than a few minutes can be very dangerous and damaging to their brain. Also note how long after the seizure stops before them become responsive. I legit took notes after his seizure stopped because I didn’t want to forget anything that happened (besides it was 3am and I was running straight off of adrenaline; I wouldn’t have remembered half the shit that happened!). Your doctor will thank you later. 

5. Call 911 if it is their first seizure, it occurs for more than 5 minutes or another seizure occurs right after. 
Yeah I made this mistake. With my background, seizures would happen pretty frequently and we never called 911 unless it happened for more than 5 mins. I should have gone straight to the ER but we waited until 6am to go because he was responsive and back to normal 15-20 mins afterwards...with the exception of a terrible headache, of course. 

The link below is from the Epilepsy Foundation on a tips and guide to a seizure. I hope no one ever has to experience their SO or loved one have a seizure! Be well, friends!

YouShouldKnow,7qxoqf,"YSK theres a multilevel marketing ""game"" going around","Sorry if this is long, messy, and a bit repetitive, I just want to make sure the point gets across and that  everything is explained well.

There's a new"" ""game"" spreading around, mostly with those in highschool as far as I can tell that's a multilevel marketing scam. While often called a game or because a lottery or gambling is not appropriate because it is a fixed outcome, you should not fall into it.

The most common version I've seen is a $20 buy in that puts you on a ladder or board. As more people join, you get pushed up the ladder and the higher you are the more money you get/when you get to the top you get a grand prize (I've seen it as $160 and will be using this number to explain). 

Since there needs to be $160 for every grand prize ""winner"" that means that 8 people have to buy in for per winner and the other 7 get screwed over. The burden of being screwed over gets passed down the ladder to more and more people resulting in 85% of ""players"" (suckers) losing and being out $20 without having a chance at winning. 

Important things to note: there can only be a maximum of 11 tiers/rounds for everyone on the planet to play once. This means that its very quickly going to get to a point where you can't win if you enter.

It's a fixed game. Only the first who join can win (and that's only if it gets popular enough). If you join late you're going to lose.

By the time you're hearing about this, a large portion of those who are going to win already have so you're going to be on the bottom more than likely and lose.

If you join and rope your friends in after you, you're responsible for their loss and for screwing them over.

There are winners in this but it is only the early players who do. Don't join it, don't spread it, don't screw yourself and others over.

Recap about why it doesn't work:
Not enough money in the system. Per 8 people put in $20 for a $160 payout to the winner. That's all the money in the system and the other 7 lose. 

There can only be a maximum of about 11 tiers 8¹¹ is about 8.6 billion players. Not everyone is going to join, in fact most people shouldn't so there's going to be a lot of losers. 

It's a fixed system. This isn't a lottery. You don't have a *chance* to win. Only the early win. 

Even if you are one of the first to join, you can't join a second time because you'll be in the bottom 85% at that point and unless money magically multiplies by 8 each round (which it doesn't as we all know) you won't win

It's a completely unsustainable model designed to take advantage of the unaware


Please parents and siblings, educate about multilevel marketing. People who hear about it, please don't join and spread it. The bigger it gets, the more people get burned, and it will be your fault if you do. This is not a game, it's a scam.

So YSK: freezing is a counterintuitive but extremely common response.

As discussed in this https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-assault-may-trigger-involuntary-paralysis Scientific American article, studies suggest that many survivors experience some level of this phenomenon:
"" [of] 300 women who visited the rape clinic, 70 percent experienced at least “significant” tonic immobility and 48 percent met the criteria for “extreme” tonic immobility during the rape.""

Why does this happen? It's all part of what you probably learned is the ""fight or flight"" response. But it's a little more complicated: ""Typically, nonhuman animals are programmed to go through each of the states as the proximity of the danger escalates. The stages are: arousal (alertness to possible danger); freezing (momentarily putting flight or fight on hold while assessing danger); “flight or fight”; tonic immobility; collapsed immobility (fainting in fear); and quiescent immobility (a subsequent state of rest that promotes healing). People who experience sexual assault may go through several of these stages, or skip straight to tonic immobility.""

How does that manifest? This Washington Post article https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/?utm_term=.3726d9ab80f1 gives some explanation:

Some describe feeling “sleepy.” Another, more common reflexive response is dissociation: spacing out, feeling unreal, disconnected from the horrible emotions and sensations of such an intimate violation.""

All of these responses are involuntary, and can be so confusing and upsetting for survivors trying to understand their own behavior. The WaPo article suggests male survivors might be especially vulnerable to this self-doubt, questioning not only whether a man can be raped (YES) but whether their passivity is unmanly.

If your state is ""under review"" like NY, MI, and LA (shaded blue) then you might still have the January 22nd deadline if the extension isn't granted, and immediate action should be taken on your part (do some research or apply for a passport, etc). Passports will of course require citizenship, so permanent residents should probably use their green cards, and other residential statuses will need to plan accordingly. Another user mentioned you can fly without an ID, but extra security measures will be taken during screening. Plan accordingly and allow extra time at the airport if any of this applies to you. 

TL;DR - check the DHS website above. Apply for passport if your state's drivers license doesn't meet criteria for traveling domestically in US. "

Last night, I made a visit to a local neighborhood park; open to the public and still open as the park sign read as Rule #1- ""Park open daily until 11:00PM"". There's even a closing guard chain to remind folks that the park is in fact closed.

At around 6:12pm yesterday, I stopped at the park to take a walk. Being the winter, it was dark and the park was only partially lit but still open nonetheless.

I parked in a regular spot. Not handicap or any way restricted.About ~30 minutes  into my park visit, I was the only vehicle in the lot. When I arrived, there were 3.

A hazard light lit flat bed tow truck approached my vehicle about 40 yards ahead of me. He took the time to shine his light on my VIN tag; the first steps to claiming a vehicle.

I hollered and startled him; asking him why he's bothering my property. He clearly didn't see me until I made some noise.

I asked him what he was doing and why my vehicle was being blocked by his truck. He literally just said ""Sorry."" and scurried off. No explanation or dialogue as to why he was scoping my vehicle (which is a little older, '98). I tried to get the name of the driver and tow company to file a formal complaint but he was gone THAT quick.

Relieved, I stepped back and asked myself if I was in the wrong in anyway. I was not--the park was open (a lot of people were walking their dogs), I parked in an acceptable space (not blocking or impeding business in anyway). My vehicle didn't have visible damage or a flat tire--indication of abandonment, there were no posted signs of any sort, NOTHING.

This led me to research ""unethical towing"" which later was identified as ""predatory towing"".

Below is what I found from a site in 2007 for California. [Consumer Action Protect Yourself](https://www.consumer-action.org/alerts/articles/protecting_yourself_from_predatory_towing). It may be out-of-state and a little dated but take the time to look up your rights in your area/jurisdiction. Be in the know before they tow.



*1. **One-Hour Rule** A vehicle must be parked for one full hour before being towed unless it is parked in a manner that interferes with an entrance or exit, is within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, or in a fire lane. The curb of a fire lane must be painted red and be clearly labeled “No Parking Fire Lane.”

2. **Unconditional Release** If a vehicle owner encounters a tower removing his or her vehicle but the truck is not yet on a public road, the owner may demand the immediate and unconditional release of the vehicle. The law does not require the owner to provide a driver’s license.

3. **Reasonable Release Fee** If the tower releases a vehicle that has been illegally parked, the tower is entitled to no more than one-half his normal towing fee. Local law enforcement can tell you what the normal towing fee is for your area.

4. **Ten-Mile Limit** A tower cannot take your vehicle to a storage lot that is more than ten miles from where it was parked.

5. **Clearly Posted Warning** A tower must have written consent from the property owner or his agent, who must have waited one hour before calling for the tow. Also, a sign not less than 17 inches by 22 inches in size should be displayed in plain view at all entrances to the property.

It should prohibit public parking and indicate that vehicles will be removed at the owner’s expense, and post the telephone number of the local traffic law enforcement agency and the name and telephone number of each towing company that is a party to a written general towing authorization agreement with the property owner.

6. **Valid Towing Permit** (photos, records, no kick-backs) The tower must have a valid motor carrier permit, shall make records and photographs of each tow available for law enforcement, and shall not share profits from towing with property owners who call for a vehicle removal.

7. **Credit Cards OK** The tower must accept credit cards in payment for towing and storage fees, which must be reasonable.

8. **Compliance Within 24 Hours = One Day Maximum Storage Charge** If the appropriate fees are paid within the initial 24 hours of storage and the storage facility fails to comply or is not open during normal business hours, then only one day’s storage fee may be charged.

9. **Reasonable Gate Fee** The gate fee, or maximum hourly charge for releasing a vehicle after normal business hours, shall be one half the hourly tow rate charged for initially towing the vehicle, or less.

10. **Penalty for Excessive Charges** A person who charges a vehicle owner a towing service or storage charge at an excessive rate is liable to the vehicle owner for four times the amount charged.*",1512842557,"about ""Predatory Towing"" and your tools to challenge it in the event you're parked legally.

--&gt; Then I looked back at some older rides and realized this isn't the first time! I've contacted uber, and have receipts that prove I was dropped off and uptown for over 2 hours so interested to see what htey say back

2) Drivers don't want to cancel rides they don't want, so they just drive around or use other apps wanting you to get frustrated, cancel and pay the $5. Don't pander to that shit, if you don't want the ride cancel it yourself, I'm not going ot get a worse rating or pay $5 because you don't want to come 2 blocks over to pick me up.

YouShouldKnow,7b337q,YSK to check the settings on your vehicle's headlights,"Lately I've seen a ton of cars on the road at night with no taillights, even though they have headlights on.

These are *daytime running lights* that offer just enough light in the city to make it seem like your lights are fully on. This does not turn on your taillights, however, making you a hazard on the road - especially coming into winter when flying snow can obscure the vision of everyone on the road.

So next time you're out at night, get out and walk around your car to see if all four lights are on. If yes, carry on. If no, check the headlights setting - usually on the left side of your steering wheel (Canada/USA). There may be simple on-off switches, or there might be an auto setting. Use the auto setting if you have it, as it is designed to turn on all lights when the sun goes down.

If turning the switch to auto or on doesn't turn on your taillights, you may need new fuses or lamps. Some cars make the changes easy enough to do at home, and some don't. Google your car to see, and proceed as necessary.

YouShouldKnow,7a06jt,YSK about a jury duty telephone scam,"I learned about this the stressful way.  You should know it's out there so you can avoid it.

I got a call at 7:30 this morning on my cell phone. The guy on the other end says he's a US Marshal. He says that I missed jury duty and a judge issued a warrant for my arrest. He says he has my signature on a document which I sent back to the government saying I received the jury duty summons.

I tell him I never received a summons and that I certainly didn't sign anything saying I did. He wants me to come down to the federal courthouse downtown and submit to a handwriting analysis to prove that it wasn't my signature.

He says that since I'm cooperating he'll suspend the warrants temporarily. I need to stay on the phone with him as I drive down. He says I have $2500 worth of bond I need to pay if I want to leave after that. If my signature doesn't match, I'll get the money back. If it does, I lose the money. [What happened to due process? And a lawyer?] Either way I'm assigned a new date to show up for jury duty.

So, I need to go to my bank (which isn't even open yet) and get the money, then go to another store to change the cash into a ""pack"" card. That's the only thing that the government will take. [I guess cash isn't ""legal tender for all debts public and private"" anymore.] He wanted me to get the pack cards at a Family Dollar or Holiday gas station. [Such big red flags. Why didn't I stop there?]

It's not this straight forward, of course. He was really good at leading me down the garden path. I was alert for him asking for any financial information over the phone, but he didn't. He even had a spiel about how the government never does that. He made it seem like his goal was really to get me into the lobby of the courthouse so he could bring me upstairs and we could deal with the warrant.

I'm not a complete rube (I hope). I googled some stuff. The courthouse address he gave me was a real courthouse. The judge's name was a real judge there. [I guess he googled stuff too.] Google said there was a jury duty scam going around, but it was all about getting you to give him financial information over the phone. He wasn't doing that. So, was it a scam because marshals really do this ""bring you in over the phone"" thing? Or was it all baloney?

He was reading from a script. He wasn't dumb, but I'm not sure he sounded smart enough to write the script. Does somebody write generic ""missed jury duty scam"" scripts and sell them to would-be scammers?

It was 8:30 by the time he we got to the part about leaving the house to go to the bank. I told him that the bank didn't open until 9:00. So, we waited for a while. I asked him about running into this problem a lot and he said he was a real ""go getter"" and showed up early and stayed late. I don't remember what else we talked about for those 30 minutes, but it wasn't dead air or chit-chat. He was good at stalling.

He asked me for the odometer reading on my car so he could reimburse me for my mileage driving to the courthouse. How considerate. I guess I gave him that bit of personal information. It's 155053, in case you're wondering.

I get to the bank. He tells me to put him on hold while I get the money. I go in and fill out a withdrawal slip. I give it to the cashier. I ask her ""can I ask you a dumb question?"" and I explain why I'm there. ""Is this a scam or am I about to get mugged?"" She goes to her manager and they come back and, much to their credit, say they think it's a scam and refuse to perform the transaction.

So, I had a second opinion. I'm feeling a bit better about standing up for myself. I leave the bank and tell the guy on the phone that the bank wouldn't give me the money. I'd cooperate and go down to the courthouse to meet him if he wanted, but I'd be pennyless. He could arrest me.

My only satisfaction about the whole thing was how he complained about wasting his time before he hung up the phone. We were talking for almost two hours.

So, no money lost. No personal information given out. I still feel like a fool, though.

Anybody have any bridges they're willing to sell me?

YouShouldKnow,79l5yu,"YSK that if you pay with a credit card at Target, the company sells your in-store purchase history to advertisers","Many people are unaware of how invasive Target's privacy policy is and how it builds profiles across multiple platforms to sell your data to advertisers. Target attempts to link: 
- everything you buy in store (including the Target pharmacy) 
- anything you say on your various interweb accounts 
- data for sale from 3rd parties on your age and income 

This creates a rich dataset that can result in very deep targeting across the interwebs (and thus lots of revenue for Target).

For example, [this woman mistakenly attributed the ads she saw after experiencing a burn](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41776215) (8th paragraph) to FB listening through her phone's microphone, though the true source was likely the purchase she made at Target.

*We collect data that is publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network) can be read, collected or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience.*

They are an independent body who have a legal duty to arbitrate between banks and financial companies when a customer feels their complaint has not been dealt with properly.

Yes, £550 is pocket change to PayPal as a company, but each department has financial targets to meet, and £550 being paid to the FSO every time they limit a customers account will eventually make them change their thought process.

My PayPal account was limited several years ago because apparently it was 'connected' to another person's account and they refused to even discuss it with me despite them holding over £2,000 of my money.
The FSO stepped in and within a week, I received a phone call from their head of customer relations who apologized profusely and said that the connection was 'extremely weak' and could have been something as simple as connecting to the same public WiFi network as the other person. My account was reactivated within minutes.

The second time was a year ago when I tried to change my bank account and it kept giving me a 'Server Error' message.
Their call center in the Philippines refused to even raise a complaint about the issue, citing that if I can't add a bank account then I should just 'spend the money' in my account on eBay.

Another complaint to the FSO and within a week I had another phone call explaining that it wasn't a 'Server Error' at all and it was another false-positive picked up by their security software.

YouShouldKnow,747lcv,YSK: A flu shot isn't just for you. It protects people who can't get a flu shot.,"Every year around this time, you see reminders to get your flu vaccine, and every year, a bunch of people don't do it, for one reason or another. ""I never get the flu anyway."" ""The flu shot makes me sick, so why bother?"" ""It doesn't even work, so what's the point?""

The point is that in addition to protecting *you* against the most common strains of the flu each year, we need a critical mass of people to get vaccinated to prevent the flu from spreading at all, so people that *can't* get the vaccine - the very young, elderly, or immunocompromised - are protected, too. This is super important, since this is the group most likely to suffer serious complications if they get the flu, including death. 

[This is called ""herd immunity,"" or ""community immunity.""](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/index.html) The point is that [if a high enough percentage of people are immune, there are too few susceptible people for the virus (that was a typo, thank you) to spread.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Herd_immunity.svg/512px-Herd_immunity.svg.png) We've successfully done this with diseases like measles and mumps ([except where anti-vaccers have caused outbreaks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/03/failure-to-vaccinate-is-likely-driver-of-u-s-measles-outbreaks-report-says/)). 

So YSK, get a flu shot, because it'll probably keep you from getting the flu, and grandma needs you to get the flu shot so *she* doesn't get the flu when you sneeze in the supermarket. Grandmas and newborns everywhere thank you. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:**

Just to clear up a few things.

The flu vaccine [varies in effectiveness](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm) from year to year, based on how well it matches the circulating strains of influenza, but generally goes a good job reducing your risk of becoming sick with the flu by 40-50%. Each year, the vaccine protects against three strains, and [a lot of work](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/vaccine-selection.htm) goes in to determining which strains are most likely to be common. It isn't just guesswork. 

&amp;nbsp;

That doesn't sound effective enough to want to get the vaccine? Here's a more important number: The CDC estimates there are about 20 to 30 THOUSAND flu-associated deaths a year, on average, mostly from secondary respiratory infections like pneumonia. But to see what a big deal the vaccine makes, we can compare a ""good"" year and a ""bad"" year. The ""bad"" year was 2004, when the vaccine was largely ineffective. There were about 45,000 flu-associated deaths that year. The ""good"" year, oddly enough, was 2009, the year H1N1 scared everyone, with about 15,000 deaths.

Why the difference? No vaccine in 2004, but a very effective vaccine and higher-than-normal vaccination rates in 2009.

#*Step Number One.Oh*

*Relax.* Your info isn't likely to be used unless you lose the lottery I talk about later. And nobody is playing the lottery until about 90 days from now. So *relax.* But take it seriously. This is still important. 

#*Purpose:*

I am making this because I see a lot of younger or more inexperienced or just unknowledgeable comments and questions about this breach. If you don’t know if you’ve been affected, or it affects you, or what the effects in question even are **that’s okay!** Especially for you younger folks, teen adults, people that haven’t worked with credit or law a lot you aren’t expected to magically know everything. Since I’m seeing advice scattered everywhere I thought I would consolidate it the best I can. 

#*What Happened?*

Equifax, one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States, was breached and over 140,000,000 people had their entire credit history stolen. Credit history includes your Social Security Number, past addresses, all previously held accounts, all inquired accounts, any bankruptcies within the last seven years, and more. 

#*How do I know if I was affected?*

Are you an American adult that has ever held or inquired about a credit card, loan, car, bank account, cell phone account, electric service, water service, internet service, a security clearance, most jobs, most schools, most apartment complexes, or renting a house? ***Congratulations! You’re affected!*** I’m seeing a lot of “Well, if you ever did X…” Or “If you ever signed anything with this fine print…” 

Nope. If you’ve ever applied for anything financial related in the United States then Equifax has been spying on you. Not like Big Brother, but Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian spy on you via financial history which every lender and creditor in the nation sends to them. 

#*When did I consent to this?*

You didn’t. Shame, but that’s the reality. It was likely hidden in the fine print of the first checking account you tried to open or when you inquired about buying a car but let’s be honest – it isn’t consensual regardless. You have no choice because it is pretty much impossible to actually live so off the grid you’ve never had any credit history. If someone used the same leverage to pressure you into giving them sex instead of your SSN it would be considered rape. Will this hold up in court? Almost definitely not. So you’re stuck with the rest of us. 

#*How is this different than other breaches?*

A lot of people brought up the US Office of Personnel Management Breach, or Target, or Yahoo, or PlayStation Network. This one is not very similar to those at all. The closest you’re getting in past examples is OPM. Here’s why: Target, Yahoo, and PSN don’t keep track of SSNs. They don’t keep track of every bill you’ve ever paid. They don’t keep track of everything you’ve ever thought about buying through financing or credit card. Target, Yahoo, and PSN’s biggest damages were your Debit or Credit Information being compromised. Big deal; cancel the card and get a new one. ***With Equifax, we can’t do that.*** You can theoretically request a new SSN but that request is not likely to be answered, especially on this scale. OPM was the only one similar to this, but that only affected government employees and it was stolen most likely by the Chinese Government. Fortunately for us, probably to spy on us rather than ruin our lives. 

#*So what happens now that my information has been stolen?*

Well now you get to play the anti-lottery. 140,000,000+ people, virtually every adult in the United States, has been entered into a lottery of epic proportions. Only in this case you *don’t* want to win. What does this mean for you? Well, it means if you have luck as bad as or worse than mine you ought to be concerned. *Is the chance of you being the unlucky loser likely?* Nope. But you sure as hell don’t want to be. 

#*What happens if I lose this lottery?*

Then you get to spend literally years fighting to prove to everyone that you are the real you and not the identity thief. During this fight you will not likely be eligible to do anything that requires credit – no cars, no house, no loans, maybe even no utilities or home rentals. If you’re like me and don’t have family to fall back on for a few years in this scenario then you should be the utmost concerned because this will make your life a living hell for 3-4 years. 

#*How can I improve my chances?*
This is where we get to your actual LifeProTip. Here are the processes you should undertake immediately if it applies to you.

   1) Get a copy of your credit report **today.**

Regardless of freeze, alert, or regular credit monitoring get your current credit report to keep on file so you can identify anything new that shouldn’t be there in the future.

*REEE HAIL CORPORATE PLUGGING THEIR SITE REEEE*


No. The Federal Government of the United States requires each of those three credit agencies give you a free copy of your credit report every year and this is the *only* authorized site to actually collect on that.
Usually I’d suggest not getting them all at once but if you can’t afford to keep paying for all this crap then go ahead and pull all three at once. Again, if you’re like me and move around a lot the website may not like you very much. Jump through its stupid hoops to get it mailed if you have to. The credit agencies *have* to honor your request. Document this shit well. 

If you don't believe me see any of the following links. This is ***the only real free credit report site***.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnnualCreditReport.com

Credit Karma et al are not free. They might not charge you, but somebody is paying them to do that service. Keep that in mind. 

   2) Freeze your credit. **Right. Fucking. Now.**

Call the three credit agencies, the same bullshit enterprise that allowed this to happen, and put a freeze on your credit. *What does this do?* Well, it freezes your credit. *Nobody*, including yourself, can inquire into your credit for any reason until this freeze is unfrozen. 

**This does not affect current accounts! Your current loans will be fine.**

*Does this cost money?* 


*Does unfreezing cost money? Isn’t this a pain in the ass?*

Yes, but only slightly. It will cost about $30 to unfreeze all three when you need to finance something but here’s the bright side: $30 and a few minutes on the phone with an automated system is a hell of a lot easier than the hell that will be your identity being stolen. And besides, if you can’t afford the $30 and a day of preparation before financing something - *you probably shouldn’t be financing anything anyway.* And I’ll tell you a little later how to get it back.

Ultimately the fee varies by State. 

*Does this affect my credit score?*

Nope. Your credit will go on as usual, but nothing new can be added or inquired during the freeze. You will still be able to use your credit card. 

#Here are the phone numbers to initiate a credit freeze

- TransUnion: 1-888-909-8872

- Equifax: 1-800-349-9960

- Experian: 1 888 397 3742

**You must call all three!**

You *can* do this online, but Equifax’s site has been crashing nonstop since the breach was announced and the system doesn’t like people like me that move around a lot. I’d suggest using the phone. It is an automated system so don’t worry about interacting with a person. 

#Important! 

**What is to stop the credit thief from lifting my freeze?**

A long PIN that will be supplied to you when you freeze it. This is pretty much it so make damned sure not to lose that. If there is another breach like this while you have the freeze, unfreeze it ASAP, then freeze it again to get a new PIN. *Yes, this costs money. It costs less than having your identity stolen. And you might be able to get it back.* 

TransUnion allows you to set your own PIN, Experian will send it in the mail, Equifax will set it for you and give it to you over the phone after your freeze is initiated. ***IMPORTANT! Do not hang up until you have it written down!*** You can make it replay the message over and over. Listen to the automated prompts. 


  3) Initiate a Fraud Alert **If you don’t do a credit freeze, at least do this.**

You are a victim of identity theft now. Contact your local police station, tell them you need to file the report to initiate the appropriate processes. They may not know what you’re talking about but they will do it if you explain. 

**[This site right here gives you a checklist on how to initiate the fraud alert.](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0279-extended-fraud-alerts-and-credit-freezes)** 

This normally costs money but you’re a victim now. This is why you need the police report/Identity Theft Report. This makes it free. This requires that anyone who wants to run your credit is going to have to jump through extra hoops to verify your identity. 
This may be a pain for you, but sure as hell a lot less pain than fighting through identity theft for four years. 



   4)  Opt out of prescreened offers of credit while you’re at it. 

This incident is probably gonna inspire you to get off the grid a bit more. You tired of junk mail? Well here’s how you reduce a ton of it:

**Alright. Done. Now how do I get some of this money back? What is our legal recourse? How do we punish Equifax?**

I want you to do something right now while you’re angry. I want you to type up a clear, polite, but strongly worded email. Prepare it as if you’re sending it to the President himself. 

[Click this link and send it to everyone on that list, both Federal and State.](http://act.commoncause.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sunlight_advocacy_list_page) 

*Will this get my money back?* 


No. Not yet. But let’s get started on that. 


#*Your legal recourse comes down to small claims court, personal formal suit, or class action.* 

For all of these cases DO NOT ENROLL IN EQUIFAX’S “IDENTITY PROTECTION”. Fuck that horseshit. We don’t trust these people anymore, remember? 

Your legal recourse comes down to how you were affected. Consult a lawyer. **Please read the bottom of the post.** You cannot sue without evidence of some kind. DO NOT get into a lawsuit with a $17B company without talking to a lawyer and having a damn good reason. 

If you are directly impacted, here are the possible options. Again, **talk to a lawyer.** 

So here’s the pros and cons of each other recourse: 

**Small Claims**

This is the most likely in which you actually get anything back, but that doesn't make it easy. Your limitations will vary by State and County. Some jurisdictions allow you to sue for up to $25,000 in small claims. Most limit it much lower at like $3,500. The amount you choose is totally up to you but we’ll get to coming up with a number in a moment. 

Pros: 

- Most likely to actually get you paid

- Do not need a lawyer

- Less formal court process

- Ironically, this will likely do the most damage to Equifax if enough people do it.

- Equifax will probably not even send a lawyer to deal with it if they get served with enough of them.

Cons: 

- Difficult process for some

- Still costs court fees

- Actually getting the judgement and collecting the judgement are two totally different things

- There is no discovery process in small claims.


**Formal Lawsuit**

This will get you the biggest personal payout - ***if*** *you win*. Keep in mind you’ll be going up against a $17B company so even when fighting many lawsuits they will likely have more firepower than you in almost any case. The good news for us little guys in this case is some very wealthy people would have also gotten their info stolen so if we’re lucky some other big guns will be taking them to court personally, but I wouldn’t count on it. 

Pros:

- Biggest possible personal payout

- There is a discovery process

- Will cost Equifax even if they win

- Collecting on these judgements is going to be way simpler since you have a lawyer

- Less personally intense for you

Cons:

- Most expensive option

- Requires a lawyer (going without one would be suicide)

- You will need a cyber security expert

- You will need a financial sector expert

- You will need to be able to prove that Equifax could have done more


**Class Action**

**Most of us will fall into this one.**

This one is already in the works. It will likely cost Equifax somewhere in the $100M range, the lawyers will collect 40% of it, and the few millions of us that apply to be part of the class will get a few bucks out of it. Equifax is already preparing to pay out for this and it won’t even faze them if this is the worst thing that happens. 

Pros:

- Super easy. All you need to do is send the lawyers your info. They will probably set up a website in a few months for all of us to do that.

- Much easier to win. Hell at this point I’d say its guaranteed to win. 

- You get a few dollars.

Cons

- You will only get a few dollars

- This won’t even faze Equifax as a company.

- You lose your ability to sue them as an individual if you sign on as a member of the Class. 


#*Which is right for me?*

Consult a lawyer. Do not try to do this completely on your own. Even with Small Claims at least consult one first. 


#*Last Steps!*

File your tax return as soon as possible from here on out. With your credit frozen and a fraud alert in place your biggest risk of direct impact is going to come from a fraudulent tax return. Unfortunately, the powers that be at the IRS don’t bother to confirm identity on tax filings except for a SSN. If somebody files with your SSN you will not be able to file. You will have to dispute it. I have seen people have to go through this battle before and it is very long. Hound your employers to get your W-2 ASAP.


If your identity is stolen and used this way [TurboTax keeps a webpage](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/General-Tax-Tips/Identity-Theft--What-to-Do-if-Someone-Has-Already-Filed-Taxes-Using-Your-Social-Security-Number/INF23035.html) to make fighting this battle a little easier. 


**The IRS will never contact you by phone or email to verify your identity!** However, if *you contact them* they will be willing to verify over the phone. If you get a call *from* anyone claiming to be the IRS for this purpose hang up, look up the IRS number, and call them instead. 


[Here is the IRS official page on the subject.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tips-for-taxpayers-victims-about-identity-theft-and-tax-returns)

#*Is there any part of my identity that is secure?*

Our birth certificates and passports are about all we've got left right now. 

**Birth Certificates**

If you only have one copy of your birth certificate look up your County of Birth's rules on requesting a new one. This will probably cost about $20 as well. The birth certificate is one of the end-all-be-all points of our identity. Keep them in locked and fire proof boxes. Worst case scenario for you is having your identity stolen and then having a fire take these documents. Make sure both can't happen at the same time at least.

Since it relies on birth certificates I highly suggest reading further on Passports.

**Naturalization Forms**

If you are a Naturalized American then do the same as the Birth Certificate folks, but with your citizenship documents. A birth certificate from your country of birth certainly wouldn't hurt either. 

**Passports**

 If you don't have one look into getting a Passport. This will prevent one from being made in your name with your birth certificate in the future, may help you prove your identity if necessary, and you can also travel to Europe, Canada, and Mexico without a visa in most cases. Win-win-win. 

Passports use various methods for confirming your identity but the lynchpin is your birth certificate. You'll have to send a 2""x2"" photo and a certified original copy of your birth certificate off the State Department to get your Passport. The photo can be done at a UPS Store or CVS or similar places and costs like $5. The Passport fee itself is closer to $100. 

The State Department will send back your birth certificate when they are done with it but I would suggest having more than one *original* on hand. Photocopies are not good enough for either case. 

#*Additions for non-Americans*

**Canada**

According to the news I can find it is likely the Equifax breach compromised information for Canadians but Equifax Canada won't saw how many. Their only official comment was that they have nothing to add to what Atlanta-based Equifax already announced. According to their website they have no idea how many were affected yet. However, judging by how large the compromise was for Americans unless Canadians and Britons are kept on entirely different networks with no trusted relationship, its likely going to be all of you as well. 

All of the following information is subject to research I've done solely today so allow some room for error: 

Canada only has Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, so things are 33% easier.

Steps you can take: 

1) Monitor your credit score. Get a report. [TransUnion Click here.](https://ocs.transunion.ca/ocs/home.html) [Equifax Click Here.](http://www.consumer.equifax.ca/home/en_ca) In Canada the free reports are done by mail. 

2) [According to CreditCards.com](http://canada.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/file-alerts-are-Canadas-answer-to-US-report-freezes-1264/) Canadians can request a Credit File Alert which is their equivalent of a credit freeze. 

3) If you find out you were affected and your SIN was stolen, [file a police report and alert all of your banks.](http://www.kiplinger.com/article/credit/T048-C000-S002-how-to-combat-stolen-social-security-numbers.html) 


**UK**

Same as Canada, all of this is based on research from today only. I am far from an expert on foreign personal credit and finance law. 

[Media reports, largely sensational in appearance claim up to 44m Britons may have been compromised.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/08/equifax-told-to-inform-britons-whether-they-are-at-risk-after-data-breach) However, judging by how large the compromise was for Americans unless Canadians and Britons are kept on entirely different networks with no trusted relationship, its likely going to be all of you as well. 

Steps you can take: 

1) Check your credit reports. Unfortunately it doesn't look like truly free reports exist in the UK. Instead there is a Statutory £2 Credit Report.

#*For American Parents*

You can freeze your child's credit once they have an SSN! They probably don't have an Equifax file unless you've had them apply for banks and credit cards already, but freezing it when they are young is not a bad idea! 

#*Advice from an actual lawyer*

Contact your own lawyer if you want to file a suit but here is a comment from a lawyer here on reddit that I think is the most realistic. 

&gt;Equifax was very, very negligent in letting their systems get breached. But until there's an actual injury, you can't win any lawsuit unless there are statutory damages, which almost certainly brings it into the federal court realm. You can't just pick a random-ass number and say ""I was harmed for this amount.""
&gt;No, you can't get it for emotional damages. No, you can't get it for pain and suffering. Unless your ID was actually stolen and used to open a line of credit, your best option is to remain in the class action.

- /u/edsbf1

Lawsuits are not clear cut. This is why law school is three years and after that there are State Bar Exams. ",1505230138,"What your options for responding to Equifax are because if you're an American adult you have almost definitely been compromised.

#*Step Number One.Oh*

*Relax.* Your info isn't likely to be used unless you lose the lottery I talk about later. And nobody is playing the lottery until about 90 days from now. So *relax.* But take it seriously. This is still important. 

#*Purpose:*

I am making this because I see a lot of younger or more inexperienced or just unknowledgeable comments and questions about this breach. If you don’t know if you’ve been affected, or it affects you, or what the effects in question even are **that’s okay!** Especially for you younger folks, teen adults, people that haven’t worked with credit or law a lot you aren’t expected to magically know everything. Since I’m seeing advice scattered everywhere I thought I would consolidate it the best I can. 

#*What Happened?*

Equifax, one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States, was breached and over 140kk people had their entire credit history stolen. Credit history includes your Social Security Number, past addresses, all previously held accounts, all inquired accounts, any bankruptcies within the last seven years, and more. 

#*How do I know if I was affected?*

Are you an American adult that has ever held or inquired about a credit card, loan, car, bank account, cell phone account, electric service, water service, internet service, a security clearance, most jobs, most schools, most apartment complexes, or renting a house? ***Congratulations! You’re affected!*** I’m seeing a lot of “Well, if you ever did X…” Or “If you ever signed anything with this fine print…” 

Nope. If you’ve ever applied for anything financial related in the United States then Equifax has been spying on you. Not like Big Brother, but Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian spy on you via financial history which every lender and creditor in the nation sends to them. 

#*When did I consent to this?*

You didn’t. Shame, but that’s the reality. It was likely hidden in the fine print of the first checking account you tried to open or when you inquired about buying a car but let’s be honest – it isn’t consensual regardless. You have no choice because it is pretty much impossible to actually live so off the grid you’ve never had any credit history. If someone used the same leverage to pressure you into giving them sex instead of your SSN it would be considered rape. Will this hold up in court? Almost definitely not. So you’re stuck with the rest of us. 

#*How is this different than other breaches?*

A lot of people brought up the US Office of Personnel Management Breach, or Target, or Yahoo, or PlayStation Network. This one is not very similar to those at all. The closest you’re getting in past examples is OPM. Here’s why: Target, Yahoo, and PSN don’t keep track of SSNs. They don’t keep track of every bill you’ve ever paid. They don’t keep track of everything you’ve ever thought about buying through financing or credit card. Target, Yahoo, and PSN’s biggest damages were your Debit or Credit Information being compromised. Big deal; cancel the card and get a new one. ***With Equifax, we can’t do that.*** You can theoretically request a new SSN but that request is not likely to be answered, especially on this scale. OPM was the only one similar to this, but that only affected government employees and it was stolen most likely by the Chinese Government. Fortunately for us, probably to spy on us rather than ruin our lives. 

#*So what happens now that my information has been stolen?*

Well now you get to play the anti-lottery. 140kk+ people, virtually every adult in the United States, has been entered into a lottery of epic proportions. Only in this case you *don’t* want to win. What does this mean for you? Well, it means if you have luck as bad as or worse than mine you ought to be concerned. *Is the chance of you being the unlucky loser likely?* Nope. But you sure as hell don’t want to be. 

#*What happens if I lose this lottery?*

Then you get to spend literally years fighting to prove to everyone that you are the real you and not the identity thief. During this fight you will not likely be eligible to do anything that requires credit – no cars, no house, no loans, maybe even no utilities or home rentals. If you’re like me and don’t have family to fall back on for a few years in this scenario then you should be the utmost concerned because this will make your life a living hell for 3-4 years. 

#*How can I improve my chances?*
This is where we get to your actual LifeProTip. Here are the processes you should undertake immediately if it applies to you.

   1) Get a copy of your credit report **today.**

Regardless of freeze, alert, or regular credit monitoring get your current credit report to keep on file so you can identify anything new that shouldn’t be there in the future.

Consult a lawyer. Do not try to do this completely on your own. Even with Small Claims at least consult one first. 


#*Last Steps!*

File your tax return as soon as possible from here on out. With your credit frozen and a fraud alert in place your biggest risk of direct impact is going to come from a fraudulent tax return. Unfortunately, the powers that be at the IRS don’t bother to confirm identity on tax filings except for a SSN. If somebody files with your SSN you will not be able to file. You will have to dispute it. I have seen people have to go through this battle before and it is very long. Hound your employers to get your W-2 ASAP.


If your identity is stolen and used this way [TurboTax keeps a webpage]( to make fighting this battle a little easier. 


**The IRS will never contact you by phone or email to verify your identity!** However, if *you contact them* they will be willing to verify over the phone. If you get a call *from* anyone claiming to be the IRS for this purpose hang up, look up the IRS number, and call them instead. 


[Here is the IRS official page on the subject.](

#*Is there any part of my identity that is secure?*

Our birth certificates and passports are about all we've got left right now. 

**Birth Certificates**

If you only have one copy of your birth certificate look up your County of Birth's rules on requesting a new one. This will probably cost about $20 as well. The birth certificate is one of the end-all-be-all points of our identity. Keep them in locked and fire proof boxes. Worst case scenario for you is having your identity stolen and then having a fire take these documents. Make sure both can't happen at the same time at least.

Since it relies on birth certificates I highly suggest reading further on Passports.

**Naturalization Forms**

If you are a Naturalized American then do the same as the Birth Certificate folks, but with your citizenship documents. A birth certificate from your country of birth certainly wouldn't hurt either. 

**Passports**

 If you don't have one look into getting a Passport. This will prevent one from being made in your name with your birth certificate in the future, may help you prove your identity if necessary, and you can also travel to Europe, Canada, and Mexico without a visa in most cases. Win-win-win. 

Passports use various methods for confirming your identity but the lynchpin is your birth certificate. You'll have to send a 2""x2"" photo and a certified original copy of your birth certificate off the State Department to get your Passport. The photo can be done at a UPS Store or CVS or similar places and costs like $5. The Passport fee itself is closer to $100. 

The State Department will send back your birth certificate when they are done with it but I would suggest having more than one *original* on hand. Photocopies are not good enough for either case. 

#*Additions for non-Americans*

**Canada**

According to the news I can find it is likely the Equifax breach compromised information for Canadians but Equifax Canada won't saw how many. Their only official comment was that they have nothing to add to what Atlanta-based Equifax already announced. According to their website they have no idea how many were affected yet. However, judging by how large the compromise was for Americans unless Canadians and Britons are kept on entirely different networks with no trusted relationship, its likely going to be all of you as well. 

All of the following information is subject to research I've done solely today so allow some room for error: 

Canada only has Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, so things are 33% easier.

Steps you can take: 

1) Monitor your credit score. Get a report. [TransUnion Click here.]( [Equifax Click Here.]( In Canada the free reports are done by mail. 

2) [According to CreditCards.com]( Canadians can request a Credit File Alert which is their equivalent of a credit freeze. 

3) If you find out you were affected and your SIN was stolen, [file a police report and alert all of your banks.]( 


**UK**

Same as Canada, all of this is based on research from today only. I am far from an expert on foreign personal credit and finance law. 

[Media reports, largely sensational in appearance claim up to 44m Britons may have been compromised.]( However, judging by how large the compromise was for Americans unless Canadians and Britons are kept on entirely different networks with no trusted relationship, its likely going to be all of you as well. 

Steps you can take: 

1) Check your credit reports. Unfortunately it doesn't look like truly free reports exist in the UK. Instead there is a Statutory £2 Credit Report.

2) UK equivalent to a Credit Freeze is [CIFAS.](www.cifas.org.uk)

Once active, creditors will have to jump through a few hoops to verify who you are. 

3) If you find your information has been stolen call [0300 123 20 40]( or click the link embedded. 


#*For American Parents*

You can freeze your child's credit once they have an SSN! They probably don't have an Equifax file unless you've had them apply for banks and credit cards already, but freezing it when they are young is not a bad idea! 

#*Advice from an actual lawyer*

Contact your own lawyer if you want to file a suit but here is a comment from a lawyer here on reddit that I think is the most realistic. 

&gt;Equifax was very, very negligent in letting their systems get breached. But until there's an actual injury, you can't win any lawsuit unless there are statutory damages, which almost certainly brings it into the federal court realm. You can't just pick a random-ass number and say ""I was harmed for this amount.""
&gt;No, you can't get it for emotional damages. No, you can't get it for pain and suffering. Unless your ID was actually stolen and used to open a line of credit, your best option is to remain in the class action.

* Except in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help. The respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled, before speech occurs.
* Drowning people’s mouths alternately sink below and reappear above the surface of the water. The mouths of drowning people are not above the surface of the water long enough for them to exhale, inhale, and call out for help. When the drowning people’s mouths are above the surface, they exhale and inhale quickly as their mouths start to sink below the surface of the water.
* Drowning people cannot wave for help. Nature instinctively forces them to extend their arms laterally and press down on the water’s surface. Pressing down on the surface of the water, permits drowning people to leverage their bodies so they can lift their mouths out of the water to breathe.
* Throughout the Instinctive Drowning Response, drowning people cannot voluntarily control their arm movements. Physiologically, drowning people who are struggling on the surface of the water cannot stop drowning and perform voluntary movements such as waving for help, moving toward a rescuer, or reaching out for a piece of rescue equipment.
* From beginning to end of the Instinctive Drowning Response people’s bodies remain upright in the water, with no evidence of a supporting kick.

Yes, they may order a drug screen. But they want to know what caused the issue and how to treat it.

So if you did actually take some drugs, that's fine because they absolutely are not going to turn around and call the cops on you simply because your drug screen was positive.

YouShouldKnow,6ugn7h,"YSK how to recognise a ""moral panic""","A [moral panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic) is a feeling of fear spread among a large number of people that some evil threatens the well-being of society. A Dictionary of Sociology defines a moral panic as ""the process of arousing social concern over an issue – usually the work of moral entrepreneurs and the mass media"".

The media are key players in the dissemination of moral indignation, even when they do not appear to be consciously engaged in crusading or muckraking. Simply reporting the facts can be enough to generate concern, anxiety, or panic. Stanley Cohen states that moral panic happens when ""a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests"". Examples of moral panic include the belief in widespread abduction of children by predatory paedophiles, belief in ritual abuse of women and children by satanic cults, the War on Drugs, and other public health issues.

*****

According to Stanley Cohen, often considered the researcher who first coined the term ""moral panic"", there are five key stages in the construction of a moral panic:

1. Someone, something or a group are defined as a threat to social norms or community interests

2. The threat is then depicted in a simple and recognizable symbol/form by the media

3. The portrayal of this symbol rouses public concern

4. There is a response from authorities and policy makers

5. The moral panic over the issue results in social changes within the community

*****

According to Goode and Ben-Yehuda, moral panic consists of the following characteristics:

* Concern – There must be the belief that the behaviour of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society

* Hostility – Hostility toward the group in question increases, and they become ""folk devils"". A clear division forms between ""them"" and ""us""

* Consensus – Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the ""moral entrepreneurs"" are vocal and the ""folk devils"" appear weak and disorganized

* Disproportionality – The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group;

* Volatility – Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.",1503047085,"how to recognise a ""moral panic"" A [moral panic]( is a feeling of fear spread among a large number of people that some evil threatens the well-being of society.

Instructions for Brother 9015CDW in text, Google for your own brand.","TLDR: Printer companies want you money and force you to buy extra toner. I have now reset the toner level in my Brother laser printer 4 times with no loss of printing quality or indication toner that toner is in fact low. Google howto reset these counters and save a lot of money.

For the Brother 9015CDW instructions below, and here http://imgur.com/a/1CBhX.

**

Many people know that printer companies sell their printers at low prices, and even below cost, because they know that you will come back and buy their expensive ink and toners once you own the machine.


To help 'encourage' us to buy more expensive ink and toner some printer companies not only mislead you by telling you that the toner or ink is empty or running low, but will physically stop the machine from printing further until you buy some more. 


In laser printers, as with my Brother 9015CDW, they can do this by having the printer count the number of pages printed, and shutting down further printing after the page counter is hit, regardless of how much toner is actually left. Other's will do similar things by shining a laser through the drum of powder and shutting down the printer when the laser shows the drum an undisclosed percentage empty. 


On a colour laser printer there are 4 drums of powder, each retailing at over $100 AUD each for the genuine name-brand product. This is obviously very expensive and it is frustrating to think companies mislead us and attempt to force us to buy extra product. I have now reset my printers counters 4 times, printed thousands of pages with no loss of quality or any indication that toner is anywhere near low, for me this is the equivalent of thousands of dollar in toner in just a few months, totally unnecessary.


So how to take back control of your printer? This will vary model to model, and brand to brand, but what you need to do is to Google your make and model of printer and find out if it is counting pages or estimating the level of toner by shining a laser through the toner cartridge.


If it is counting pages you need to Google how to access the printers hidden menus usually used by tech support and other types and reset the counter back to zero, from where it will start counting pages again.

For example, on my Brother DCP-9015CDW here is a how-to reset the page counter:

1. Open the printer as if you were to change the toner. Printer will display 'Close the top cover'.

2. Hold down the star key on the keyboard for around 10-20 seconds until reset menu appears. (Star key is not illuminated at this stage, you can see the dark outline, or guess where it lies on the keypad, or use printer functions while it is closed to see where the star key lies.

3. Reset everything.

4. Profit (or rather, save).

See here http://imgur.com/a/1CBhX for pictures.


If it is shining a laser through the drum, you can get a piece of black electrical tape, or blue tak or similar, and cover the laser entry and exit points, so that the laser always reports back full. Google this for further explanation.

TLDR: don't try to warm a baby up when it shivers, feed it instead.

Long post below with the details if you want to learn more about it**.

-------------------------------------

So maybe you're living in a home that's not brand new and while your internet is great downstairs in the basement or living room where your modem is, the wifi is weak or intermittent, and your downloads slow/lag when you play online games. Crud. You've tried powerline adapters that suck, and wifi repeaters that aren't reliable or worsen your ping. Fear not, as there is something you can try: Multimedia over CoAxial (MoCA) adapters that run your internet over the [coaxial outlets that you already have](https://i.imgur.com/onVeFIL.jpg). You can get high speeds (up to 1gbps) over them, and get great ping (have them in a family members house, with them going to an internet speedtest server they can get results below 10ms).

They're pretty easy to connect, but before you dive in, you want to make sure that you only buy what you need, that you buy the right things, and you consider whether or not MoCA is an option for you.

------------------------------------------------

*What do I need to buy? What are the components?*

To start, you need at least two MoCA adapters: One will act as a ""bridge"" that will be wired to your source of internet (e.g. your primary router) to get the devices on the coaxial (cable) wire connected to your home network. Then you will have an adapter in a room where you want wired internet for one or more devices.

*Wait, might I have a MoCA bridge already?*

Yes, but most cable companies (at least in the United States) do not use MoCA. If you certain newer models of Tivo, the main Tivo (Premiere 4, Roamio Plus/Pro, Bolt/Bolt+) can act as a MoCA bridge (connect Tivo to ethernet, then set it up in options as a MoCA bridge). If you have Verizon FiOS as your ISP and they wire the [ONT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_device#Optical_network_terminals) (grey box outside or inside your home that their fiber optic cable is wired to) to the coaxial wire in your home, then you can use the included Actiontec router they give you as a MoCA adapter (easiest way to tell is if your router is connected via coaxial (RG6) cable, instead of the RJ45 cable [RJ45 is like a phone jack but wired, e.g. wired internet port on a desktop computer, Xbox/Playstation, etc.])

*Okay, I don't have a MoCA bridge. What do I need?*

As mentioned earlier, you need two MoCA bridges. The generally recommended model right now is the ECB6200. One adapter averages online sale for around $75-$100 and a kit of two (ECB6200K02) goes for around $150-$200 online. You should also install a MoCA PoE filter [example of one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Antronix-Filter-GLF-1002-Coaxial-Networking/dp/B01EXRMIIC/), there are others but you shouldn't pay more than $10 for one). This screws in between where the cable enters your house and the first splitter you have on the input line (a splitter [looks like this](https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6651/6651202_rd.jpg, although a splitter might have anywhere between 2-8 outputs). This prevents signals over 1000mhz from leaving/entering your home, which will both increase the security of your MoCA network (by preventing neighbors on the same coax run from joining your network) and blocking signals in these ranges from your neighbors that might diminish the performance of my network. If you want to connect more than one device in the room where you have a MoCA adapter, you'll also need to buy a 4 or 8 port gigabit switch. These go on sale for less than $30 online on a pretty regular basis (8 port models).

You may also need to replace the splitter in your home if it is an older model. If it doesn't list the frequencies it supports, or it isn't labeled for 5-2400mhz, then you probably want to replace it. Splitters are generally cheaper online (an 8 port splitter from Monoprice is less than $9 on Amazon, and less than $5 from Monoprice directly).

*Okay, sounds good. Anything I should know before I order?*

Yes. MoCA generally works well in most scenarios. **It will not work if you have satellite TV running over those wires**. MoCA was designed to cooperate with incoming cable television and cable internet signals. If you have a larger home especially, then there may be narrowband splitters (e.g. those that don't go up to 2400mhz) that were used and put behind walls in home construction. This isn't common, and most homes will only have an accessible splitter in the basement. If you do have a narrowband splitter in the walls, it may limit your maximum speed achievable well below a gigabit per second. Your best bet is to buy from a merchant with a good return policy. Some credit cards (especially American Express Cards issued by Amex themselves [examples: not an Amex from Macy's or Bank of America] and many Citi credit cards) offer extended return protection, where they will refund you for the purchase price of an item if the merchant won't take it back within 90 days of purchase. Check with your issuer.

**Alright, I've ordered everything and it's arrived. Now what?**

Setting up a MoCA network is pretty simple typically. 

1) If you need to replace your splitter, do so. Unscrew all of the cables from your existing splitter and take out the new one. Keep track of which wire went to the ""IN"" of your existing splitter (mark it with a label or a piece of tape).

2) After you have unscrewed the input, screw on the MoCA PoE filter the ""IN""/""INPUT"" of your splitter. Then screw on the cable that previously went on to the ""IN""/""INPUT"" of the spliter to the PoE filter. [Example of what this looks like](https://i.imgur.com/3KBOKhF.jpg) - the cable on the top of the metal piece with blue/red sticker is the incoming cable, the red/blue stickered metal piece is the PoE filter, and the golden RCA thing is the splitter, with the PoE filter connected to IN.

3) Unbox your first MoCA adapter and prepare to connect it to your home network. Go to a location that has both a place to connect to your home network (e.g. where your router is) and a coaxial line. Connect a coaxial (cable) wire from the wall to the ""coax in"" of the adapter. If you've had to steal a wire from either your cable box or cable modem to do so, connect a coaxial (cable) wire from the ""coax out"" of the MoCA adapter to your existing cable modem/cable box. Plug in the wired internet (ethernet/RJ45) port of the MoCA adapter to one of the LAN ports on your router. Plug in the power.

4) Repeat #3, but in the room where you want wired internet (and don't have it now, but do have coaxial available), except you connect the wired internet port of the MoCA adapter (ethernet/RJ45) to either a switch or to the device you want to have wired internet.

5) Within a minute, you should see the lights ""POWER"", ""ETHERNET"", and ""COAXIAL"" all go on and turn green on both MoCA adapters. When this happens, you can try a speedtest and to access the internet. If that works, you're done - you've set up a MoCA network in your home!

----------------

**Further questions**

*I tried it and it didn't work...*

Try to make sure all the connections you did are tight/fully plugged in. Try the old reboot, unplug both MoCA bridges and plug in the one connected to your router first, wait a minute, and then plug in the additional bridges. If all else fails after following the troubleshooting guide, you might consider returning them.

*I tried it and it worked, but I'm not getting a gigabit...*

If you're doing an internet speedtest, you may simply not have gigabit internet. If you do test locally and there is no other bottleneck (e.g. a switch or router that can't process gigabit speeds) then it may be the maximum that your home network conditions permit.

*I tried it and it worked. I want internet in a [second/third/fourth] room. Can I buy additional adapters and have them work?*

Yes, assuming the coaxial jacks in those rooms work (e.g. they are connected to your splitter where all the other MoCA devices are connected to), you can buy additional bridges.

*I want to check the security settings/upgrade firmware/see the statistics of the bridges*

[There's a configuration page you can access to do these things](http://helpdeskgeek.com/networking/upgrade-actiontec-ecb6200-firmware/). Bear in mind that if you change the encryption passphrase on one adapter, you must change it on all additional adapters.

Hope this info helps and feel free to ask questions.

**Personal story**

My grandparents bought a home that was constructed in the late 1800s and was traditionally restored (e.g. plaster with metal/concrete behind it) in the 1990s. The home is beautiful, but in the 1990s most people didn't have the internet, and if they did it was dial-up - so no wired internet, just coaxial and phone lines. The home construction means wifi quickly dies, meaning signal gets blocked from much of the house. Wifi repeaters don't really help when there is barely any or no signal to repeat, and powerline adapters simply didn't work (never connected).

I bought them (a few years ago) MoCA adapters capable of speeds up to 270mbps. I bought four adapters total: one to connect to the router, and three to connect in different rooms.  I also bought three Netgear Nighthawk X10 routers, to be configured in access point mode (connect to wired ethernet from the bridges and broadcast a wifi access point, but not try to act as a router and put all devices on the network of the primary router).

In two of the target rooms, the MoCA adapter worked flawlessly - they can max out their 60mbps down/25mbps up internet with pings below 10ms to internet speed tests. In one target room (second floor, with coax run to the basement) the MoCA adapter would not work, I presume because the builders used a splitter buried behind the walls. I returned the third router (unopened) and the MoCA bridge. 

With the router at the base of the first floor, internet know reaches outside the front of the house, and through the floor construction to their second and third floors, with reliable wifi throughout the entire house and hardwired internet available at those key locations.

YouShouldKnow,6nsxtv,YSK: How to lose weight safely and keep it off!,"Preface: I am not endorsed by any site, product, brand, nor am I here to sell any product or otherwise. Just someone sick of misinformation. I myself grew up extremely misinformed about health, nutrition, and exercise. It took me years to finally understand it and I feel others should know too! 

Hi everyone! First time post here. I feel that recent trends have spread some misleading or outright wrong info about weight loss into the already massively misinformed nutritional section of the internet. 

Some tools I would highly recommend to have are:

* A weight scale 
* A Food Scale
* A Calorie Counter app/account

First things first:

**The only proven way to lose weight is through a caloric deficit.**

No matter if a fad diet promises 20 lbs in 2 weeks or to ""shed 3 sizes"", the only for-sure proven way to actually lose body fat is through caloric deficits. What is a caloric deficit? It's a reduction of calories from the daily diet to ensure you use more energy than you consume. Since the body stores excess energy as fat, it will burn those fat cells so that you still have energy to move around and such. 

**How do I eat at a caloric deficit?**

Simple! Eat less than your TDEE! That's literally it. 

**What's TDEE?**

This is deceptively simple. Really, you should know about BMR and TDEE. 

Your **B**asal **M**etabolic **R**ate is the amount of energy (calories) you use just by existing. If your body were to theoretically stay completely still for a day, this is how many calories you would need to *stay at your current weight*. This last part is important. 

Your **T**otal **D**aily **E**nergy **E**xpenditure is how many calories you use in a day including BMR and things like walking, sitting up, chewing, etc. Usually a couple hundred calories extra compared to BMR. To find out yours, use a calculator. There are dozens of these across the internet and each one is slightly different. Personally I like [this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/). 

**How accurate are these calculators?**

They are good educated guesses for what your TDEE is. It's impossible to 100% accurately pinpoint calorie burning without the proper medical equipment, so a TDEE calculator is an acceptable free alternative. It's often within a 100 calories or so of your actual TDEE. 

**Okay, so I have my TDEE. Now what?**

As I said earlier, you must now eat at a deficit. A pound weighs in at 3500 calories. If a person eats at a 500 calorie deficit (500 less than their TDEE) every day for a week, they'll have shed one pound. Repeat for 10 weeks, and you'll have lost 10 lbs. Simple!

I also mentioned earlier that while TDEE are good guessers, they aren't 100% accurate. You may find that your actual TDEE is 100-250 calories off from the guess. The best way to find this out is to weigh yourself weekly and adjust your intake according. IE: If you see that you're only losing 0.8 pounds instead of a full pound, reduce your calorie intake 100 calories or so. Keep doing so until you are losing the correct amount of weight.

As you lose, it's a good idea to recalculate your TDEE every 5-10 pounds and adjust your diet slightly. This will ensure your loss doesn't slow down too much.

**Does this mean I can just eat nothing or at an 1000+ deficit to burn the fat even faster?**

Well, yes and no. The body is extremely efficient at using calories and will dig into additionally sources if it needs it. Large deficits can lead to muscle catabolism (muscle loss) in addition to fat loss. Those without an excessive amount of fat to lose (IE: Non-obese) should not attempt 1000 deficits.  In general, anyone under 15% bodyfat should stick to a 500 calorie deficit. Any more can lead to unnecessary muscle catabolism. 

**Diet**

So, as mentioned way back in the beginning, I recommended a calorie counter. After all, how can you eat at a deficit if you don't know what the value of what you're eating is? A calorie counter is an app or journal you maintain to track how many calories you consume daily. I personally recommend something like MyFitnessPal due to its massive database and simple interface. The phone app also has a barcode scanner which makes logging snacks much easier. You can also do this manually via any number of methods, but I'd highly recommend an app. 

All you have to do at this point is set your daily goal (500 less than your TDEE) and log the food you eat each day! Food that doesn't come prepackaged is a little difficult to find amounts of (IE: 1 Chicken Breast) so this is where that food scale comes in handy. All FDA-regulated foods are required to have a serving size in grams in addition to the serving size recommended on the box (IE: 1/2 cup equals 28g). This is how a lot of snack companies fool you into thinking a serving is less calories than it actually is. All food can be accurately measured via weight. 
 
**So just salads and veggies from now on?**

This is one point a lot of people get hung up on and don't quite understand what a deficit is. While salads and veggies are great resources for vitamins and other nutrients, *you don't have to restrict any sort of food from your diet*. That's right. Pasta, ice cream, snacks, chips, dips, nachos, and all that other good stuff can be included on your diet. That being said, *you MUST factor them in to your daily allowance of calories.* 

Example scenario: You're eating at 1500 calories a day, a 500 deficit from a 2000 calorie TDEE. You can have 500 calories per meal if you plan on eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, let's say you only have access to ice cream and brownies that day. Well, if you eat exactly 1500-calories-worth of ice cream and brownies for the day, you are still losing weight! 

Sounds too good to be true, right? Well believe it. Back in 2010 Mark Haub, a professor of human nutrition at Kansas State University proved that it's calories, not nutrition or ingredients, that matter most in weight loss. He performed the now infamous [twinkie diet](http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/index.html), eating mostly sugar and carbs as his daily intake with very little protein or other nutrition. He lost over 20 pounds. 

So feel free to partake of your favorite snack or food every here and there. Just don't go too crazy and stay within your deficit! Moderation is key!

**What about carbs/keto/paleo/green tea/fish oil/whey supplements?**

Low carb diets often don't really differ much in terms of weight loss for most folks. In worst-case scenarios, they can be extremely harmful to the body. 

Supplements like green tea powder, fish oil, and others are generally not needed for weight loss unless you're suffering a deficiency. If you feel nervous, get a good multivitamin and call it a day. Most folk will get all the nutrients they need from plain old food.

Whey protein powder is an excellent crutch for those that can't get in proper amounts of protein in their regular diet, but unless you exercise you may find that you're not utilizing it. The recommended daily amount of protein for the average man is only 60g. If trying to preserve/build muscle, you should eat 0.8g per pound of lean body mass (your weight minus your amount of body fat).

**What about exercise?**

Exercise is great in addition to weight loss! Not only is it healthy, but it also keeps the muscles active to help prevent muscle loss. For some people it can even be therapeutic or relaxing. Exercise is a post all in its own, so I'd highly recommend checking out the resources linked below. 

**How long will it take?**

This is the one it's not fun to answer. It depends on how fat you are and how much weight you want to lose. The hard truth is that weight loss is fairly slow for the average person, and even an obese dieter could take a year or longer to shed most of the weight. The bright side is that it's totally doable and you don't have to starve yourself to do so. It just takes a little bit of effort and dedication. Eyes on the prize!

**How long until I can go back to regular pizza and ice cream?**

The key to keeping the weight off isn't just to lose it, but to maintain the body you've sculpted. To maintain, you need to find your now-current TDEE and not exceed that amount.

",1500296788,"How to lose weight safely and keep it off! Preface: I am not endorsed by any site, product, brand, nor am I here to sell any product or otherwise. Just someone sick of misinformation. I myself grew up extremely misinformed about health, nutrition, and exercise. It took me years to finally understand it and I feel others should know too! 

Hi everyone! First time post here. I feel that recent trends have spread some misleading or outright wrong info about weight loss into the already massively misinformed nutritional section of the internet. 

Some tools I would highly recommend to have are:

* A weight scale 
* A Food Scale
* A Calorie Counter app/account

First things first:

**The only proven way to lose weight is through a caloric deficit.**

No matter if a fad diet promises 20 lbs in 2 weeks or to ""shed 3 sizes"", the only for-sure proven way to actually lose body fat is through caloric deficits. What is a caloric deficit? It's a reduction of calories from the daily diet to ensure you use more energy than you consume. Since the body stores excess energy as fat, it will burn those fat cells so that you still have energy to move around and such. 

**How do I eat at a caloric deficit?**

Simple! Eat less than your TDEE! That's literally it. 

**What's TDEE?**

This is deceptively simple. Really, you should know about BMR and TDEE. 

Your **B**asal **M**etabolic **R**ate is the amount of energy (calories) you use just by existing. If your body were to theoretically stay completely still for a day, this is how many calories you would need to *stay at your current weight*. This last part is important. 

Your **T**otal **D**aily **E**nergy **E**xpenditure is how many calories you use in a day including BMR and things like walking, sitting up, chewing, etc. Usually a couple hundred calories extra compared to BMR. To find out yours, use a calculator. There are dozens of these across the internet and each one is slightly different. Personally I like [this one]( 

**How accurate are these calculators?**

They are good educated guesses for what your TDEE is. It's impossible to 100% accurately pinpoint calorie burning without the proper medical equipment, so a TDEE calculator is an acceptable free alternative. It's often within a 100 calories or so of your actual TDEE. 

**Okay, so I have my TDEE. Now what?**

As I said earlier, you must now eat at a deficit. A pound weighs in at 3500 calories. If a person eats at a 500 calorie deficit (500 less than their TDEE) every day for a week, they'll have shed one pound. Repeat for 10 weeks, and you'll have lost 10 lbs. Simple!

I also mentioned earlier that while TDEE are good guessers, they aren't 100% accurate. You may find that your actual TDEE is 100-250 calories off from the guess. The best way to find this out is to weigh yourself weekly and adjust your intake according. IE: If you see that you're only losing 0.8 pounds instead of a full pound, reduce your calorie intake 100 calories or so. Keep doing so until you are losing the correct amount of weight.

As you lose, it's a good idea to recalculate your TDEE every 5-10 pounds and adjust your diet slightly. This will ensure your loss doesn't slow down too much.

**Does this mean I can just eat nothing or at an 1000+ deficit to burn the fat even faster?**

Well, yes and no. The body is extremely efficient at using calories and will dig into additionally sources if it needs it. Large deficits can lead to muscle catabolism (muscle loss) in addition to fat loss. Those without an excessive amount of fat to lose (IE: Non-obese) should not attempt 1000 deficits.  In general, anyone under 15% bodyfat should stick to a 500 calorie deficit. Any more can lead to unnecessary muscle catabolism. 

**Diet**

So, as mentioned way back in the beginning, I recommended a calorie counter. After all, how can you eat at a deficit if you don't know what the value of what you're eating is? A calorie counter is an app or journal you maintain to track how many calories you consume daily. I personally recommend something like MyFitnessPal due to its massive database and simple interface. The phone app also has a barcode scanner which makes logging snacks much easier. You can also do this manually via any number of methods, but I'd highly recommend an app. 

All you have to do at this point is set your daily goal (500 less than your TDEE) and log the food you eat each day! Food that doesn't come prepackaged is a little difficult to find amounts of (IE: 1 Chicken Breast) so this is where that food scale comes in handy. All FDA-regulated foods are required to have a serving size in grams in addition to the serving size recommended on the box (IE: 1/2 cup equals 28g). This is how a lot of snack companies fool you into thinking a serving is less calories than it actually is. All food can be accurately measured via weight. 
 
**So just salads and veggies from now on?**

This is one point a lot of people get hung up on and don't quite understand what a deficit is. While salads and veggies are great resources for vitamins and other nutrients, *you don't have to restrict any sort of food from your diet*. That's right. Pasta, ice cream, snacks, chips, dips, nachos, and all that other good stuff can be included on your diet. That being said, *you MUST factor them in to your daily allowance of calories.* 

Example scenario: You're eating at 1500 calories a day, a 500 deficit from a 2000 calorie TDEE. You can have 500 calories per meal if you plan on eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, let's say you only have access to ice cream and brownies that day. Well, if you eat exactly 1500-calories-worth of ice cream and brownies for the day, you are still losing weight! 

Sounds too good to be true, right? Well believe it. Back in 2010 Mark Haub, a professor of human nutrition at Kansas State University proved that it's calories, not nutrition or ingredients, that matter most in weight loss. He performed the now infamous [twinkie diet](, eating mostly sugar and carbs as his daily intake with very little protein or other nutrition. He lost over 20 pounds. 

So feel free to partake of your favorite snack or food every here and there. Just don't go too crazy and stay within your deficit! Moderation is key!

**What about carbs/keto/paleo/green tea/fish oil/whey supplements?**

Low carb diets often don't really differ much in terms of weight loss for most folks. In worst-case scenarios, they can be extremely harmful to the body. 

Supplements like green tea powder, fish oil, and others are generally not needed for weight loss unless you're suffering a deficiency. If you feel nervous, get a good multivitamin and call it a day. Most folk will get all the nutrients they need from plain old food.

Whey protein powder is an excellent crutch for those that can't get in proper amounts of protein in their regular diet, but unless you exercise you may find that you're not utilizing it. The recommended daily amount of protein for the average man is only 60g. If trying to preserve/build muscle, you should eat 0.8g per pound of lean body mass (your weight minus your amount of body fat).

**What about exercise?**

Exercise is great in addition to weight loss! Not only is it healthy, but it also keeps the muscles active to help prevent muscle loss. For some people it can even be therapeutic or relaxing. Exercise is a post all in its own, so I'd highly recommend checking out the resources linked below.

**How long until I can go back to regular pizza and ice cream?**

The key to keeping the weight off isn't just to lose it, but to maintain the body you've scued. To maintain, you need to find your now-current TDEE and not exceed that amount.

If you're going through a messy divorce, let's say, and you're trying to negotiate every single aspect of your life, then things get a little more complicated. You can still use the strategies listed below, but they work best when you're trying to achieve ONE goal -- like lowering your cable bill or getting more vacation days at work.**

Most people (myself included) are hesitant to negotiate, *especially* when it comes to sensitive issues like our salaries or the price of a new home.

But there are two things worth knowing about negotiation...

* It's fucking uncomfortable, but it can be worth a LOT of money.  If you start a new job and negotiate your salary $1,000 higher than the initial offer, you've set a new baseline for your earning.  Over 10 years, if you did *nothing* but collect your 3% merit increase every year, that one conversation was worth $13,000+.  And conversely, if you negotiate lower interest rates on your credit cards, a cheaper cable bill, a smaller car payment, etc., the savings start piling up quickly.

* You negotiate everything in pretty much the same way -- whether it's the $600,000 price tag of the house you want to buy, or where you and your spouse want to go for dinner.  It all revolves about three parameters that you develop before entering a negotiation.

**Step #1: Figure out what you want.**

This is called your *aspiration point*.  It can be anything you want, as long as it's specific and measurable.  For example, if you wanted a salary increase, you wouldn't tell yourself, ""I want more money."" You'd say, ""I want to earn $5,000 more annually."" Your aspiration point needs to follow two rules:

* **Make it ambitious.** Don't sell yourself short.  If you think you have a realistic chance of getting a $5,000 raise, then make your aspiration point $10,000.
* **Keep it realistic.**  This seems like it violates the *make it ambitious* rule, but if your aspiration point is TOO crazy (""Boss, I demand a raise of *A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR*""), you'll lose all credibility in the negotiation.  Do a little research on whatever you're trying to negotiate, and make sure your aspiration point is ambitious, but not fucking absurd.

**Step #2: Figure out how little you're willing to accept.**

This is called your *reservation point,* and it's the absolute shittiest deal you'd be happy with.  Using the salary example, let's say your reservation point is $1,000 a year.  You asked for $10,000, you're hoping for $5,000, but shit, you'd take $1,000 if push came to shove.

If, after some back-and-forth discussion, your boss says, ""Sorry kid, you're an awesome employee, but the best I can do for you is $1,500..."" then you *take the motherfucking deal*.  Any offer that falls between your aspiration point and your reservation point is called *winning the negotiation*.  Congratulations.

So how do you know if you've set a good reservation point?  Easy.  There's only one rule:

* **It has to be better than your BATNA.**  What's a BATNA?  Great question.  See Step #3.

**Step #3: Figure out what you're going to do if the negotiation doesn't work.**

This is your BATNA -- the **B**est **A**lternative **T**o **A** **N**egotiated **A**greement.  And it's your source of power in every negotiation.  Seriously, never *ever* enter a negotiation without a BATNA.  You will lose.

If we stick with our salary increase scenario, your BATNA might be another job offer. ""I just received an offer to work downtown, for $1,000 more a year, and if I can't reach an agreement with my current boss, I'm going to accept the offer."" However, if you're looking to lower the price of your car insurance, your BATNA won't be so drastic: ""I'm going to find another insurance company who will charge me less money.""

It's just a Plan B.  That's all.  But a good BATNA needs to be three things:

* **Honest and realistic.**  If you know, deep down in your heart, that you won't actually go through with your BATNA, then it's fucking useless.  A BATNA is your Plan B.  It needs to be a realistic option for you.
* **Worse than your reservation point.** If your BATNA is better than your reservation point, then your reservation point needs to go higher.  After all, why would you walk away from your negotiation before you've reached your floor?

**Step #4: Use these parameters to guide your negotiation.**

Negotiation is about compromise.  Steps #1, #2, and #3 help you establish what you *will* compromise over, and what you *won't* compromise over.  Once you have those in place, you're going to bargain with the other party until you're offered a deal that's better than your reservation point.  If that point never comes, then you exercise your BATNA and walk away from the table.

[Here's a visual.](http://i.imgur.com/VpA7dWx.png)

There are a few key points to keep in mind during the actual negotiation.

* **It's okay to share your aspiration point.** Feel free to tell the other party what you want.  If they don't know what your goals are, then it makes it harder for them to compromise, right?
* **If the deal isn't going well, it's okay to share your BATNA.** Your BATNA shouldn't be flaunted over the other party, but it's fair to say, ""Listen, I want this to work out for both of us, but I'm prepared to do X, Y, or Z if we can't reach an agreement.""
* **Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever share your reservation point.** If they discover the worst deal you're willing to accept, then guess what?  They're going to make you that offer.  And guess what?  You're going to accept it, because you've lost all leverage.
* **If you can guess the other party's reservation point, you win.** Correctly guessing the other party's reservation point is an automatic *I WIN* button in negotiation.  Inexperienced negotiators might actually fucking *tell you* their reservation value: ""Times are tough.  All I can afford is $200."" Is $200 higher than your reservation value?  If it is, *negotiation over.*
* **If you're negotiating with someone you care about, your reputation is more important than getting an optimal deal.** If you're negotiating the price of lawn service with your best friend's brother, you might have the acumen required to absolutely fucking destroy him.  Restrain yourself.  Same goes for coworkers you'd like to work with again, or small businesses you value.  Don't negotiate in a way that will compromise your reputation.  Always be as fair as possible.  Now, on the other hand, if you're negotiating with the random customer service rep at Comcast, go fucking crazy.  Who cares?
* **If you realize you're not adequately prepared to negotiate, it's okay to reschedule and walk away.** Midway through the negotiation, you might realize that your reservation point is way too low.  Or your BATNA has a major hole in it.  Or your aspiration point is way higher than it should be.  It's okay to say, ""You know what?  Based on some things I've learned from our discussion, I'd like to take another day or two to revise my thinking.  Can we reschedule?"" That's totally fine.

Negotiation is fucking complicated.  It's a confusing blend of human psychology, business acumen, and confidence that a lot of people don't have -- that's why you hired a lawyer to ""negotiate"" with the judge after you ran that bus-full of kids off the road back in '98.

But basic negotiation is actually really simple.  It's totally process-driven.  If you can figure out (1) what you want, (2) what you're willing to accept, (3) and what you'll do if an agreement isn't reached, then you have everything you need to start negotiating stuff in your everyday life.",1499532749,"You can negotiate ANYTHING if you know (1) exactly what you want, (2) how little you're willing to accept, and (3) what you'll do if the deal doesn't work out. **Note, the method detailed in this post works best for single-issue negotiations.

This is your BATNA -- the **B**est **A**lternative **T**o **A** **N**egotiated **A**greement.  And it's your source of power in every negotiation.  Seriously, never *ever* enter a negotiation without a BATNA.  You will lose.

If we stick with our salary increase scenario, your BATNA might be another job offer. ""I just received an offer to work downtown, for $1k more a year, and if I can't reach an agreement with my current boss, I'm going to accept the offer."" However, if you're looking to lower the price of your car insurance, your BATNA won't be so drastic: ""I'm going to find another insurance company who will charge me less money.""

It's just a Plan B.  That's all.  But a good BATNA needs to be three things:

* **Honest and realistic.**  If you know, deep down in your heart, that you won't actually go through with your BATNA, then it's fucking useless.  A BATNA is your Plan B.  It needs to be a realistic option for you.
* **Worse than your reservation point.** If your BATNA is better than your reservation point, then your reservation point needs to go higher.  After all, why would you walk away from your negotiation before you've reached your floor?

**Step #4: Use these parameters to guide your negotiation.**

Negotiation is about compromise.  Steps #1, #2, and #3 help you establish what you *will* compromise over, and what you *won't* compromise over.  Once you have those in place, you're going to bargain with the other party until you're offered a deal that's better than your reservation point.  If that point never comes, then you exercise your BATNA and walk away from the table.

[Here's a visual.](

There are a few key points to keep in mind during the actual negotiation.

* **It's okay to share your aspiration point.** Feel free to tell the other party what you want.  If they don't know what your goals are, then it makes it harder for them to compromise, right?
* **If the deal isn't going well, it's okay to share your BATNA.** Your BATNA shouldn't be flaunted over the other party, but it's fair to say, ""Listen, I want this to work out for both of us, but I'm prepared to do X, Y, or Z if we can't reach an agreement.""
* **Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever share your reservation point.** If they discover the worst deal you're willing to accept, then guess what?  They're going to make you that offer.  And guess what?  You're going to accept it, because you've lost all leverage.
* **If you can guess the other party's reservation point, you win.** Correctly guessing the other party's reservation point is an automatic *I WIN* button in negotiation.  Inexperienced negotiators might actually fucking *tell you* their reservation value: ""Times are tough.  All I can afford is $200."" Is $200 higher than your reservation value?  If it is, *negotiation over.*
* **If you're negotiating with someone you care about, your reputation is more important than getting an optimal deal.** If you're negotiating the price of lawn service with your best friend's brother, you might have the acumen required to absolutely fucking destroy him.  Restrain yourself.  Same goes for coworkers you'd like to work with again, or small businesses you value.  Don't negotiate in a way that will compromise your reputation.  Always be as fair as possible.  Now, on the other hand, if you're negotiating with the random customer service rep at Comcast, go fucking crazy.  Who cares?
* **If you realize you're not adequately prepared to negotiate, it's okay to reschedule and walk away.** Midway through the negotiation, you might realize that your reservation point is way too low.  Or your BATNA has a major hole in it.  Or your aspiration point is way higher than it should be.  It's okay to say, ""You know what?  Based on some things I've learned from our discussion, I'd like to take another day or two to revise my thinking.  Can we reschedule?"" That's totally fine.

Negotiation is fucking complicated.  It's a confusing blend of human psychology, business acumen, and confidence that a lot of people don't have -- that's why you hired a lawyer to ""negotiate"" with the judge after you ran that bus-full of kids off the road back in '98.

But basic negotiation is actually really simple.  It's totally process-driven.  If you can figure out (1) what you want, (2) what you're willing to accept, (3) and what you'll do if an agreement isn't reached, then you have everything you need to start negotiating stuff in your everyday life."

YouShouldKnow,6l4nm7,"YSK That because of Fireworks, the 4th of July (in the US) can be very stressful for many pets and can lead to them escaping from their homes","Not too surprising to most, but a reminder that many pets get spooked by fireworks. Mainly Dogs it seems, but other pets as well (Cats as well, I've heard) The night of July 4th in the US sees the most cases of lost/killed animals by far, much more than any other date.

It's smart to take precautions for all pets, regardless of how unafraid they may have been of loud noises in the past. Dogs that have been fine in past years can still be unexpectedly spooked.

**Here's some tips** copied and pasted from [This Link](http://patch.com/california/temecula/4th-july-fireworks-terrifying-pets-safety-tips-follow):

 **1:** Exercise will help your dog relax, so take your dog for a walk and a potty break before the fireworks or festivities begin. Even if you’re in your yard, you may want to leash your dog in case of unexpected noise.

 **2:** Find a safe place indoors for your pet to stay. Ambient noise from a TV, radio, fan or A/C unit can help make pets feel safe.
   
**3:** Keep your windows closed.

 **4:** Avoid bringing your dog to your local Independence Day parade.
    
**5:** Inspect your fence for openings.
    
**6:** Be certain your dog’s tag is readable and up-to-date, his collar is properly fitted and, if your dog has a microchip, the information in the microchip is accurate.
    
**7:** Create a quiet place for your dog or cat. Make sure it is cool enough, comfortable enough and away from the celebrations. Once you have located the spot, make it off-limits to guests.
    
**8:** If your animal requires prescriptions to cope with the fireworks, make sure you get them well before the Fourth of July holiday. Most veterinarians are closed for the holiday and emergency clinics will not prescribe tranquilizers.
    
**9:** If you're having or attending a cook-out with a pet, remind guests to watch their plates and to properly dispose of their garbage. A steak bone/chicken bone or a corn cob is appetizing but can be deadly to your dog or cat.

**10:** Post notes or signs on back gates or front and rear doors that an animal is present and to be careful to close doors and gates when entering or exiting.
   
**11:** Make sure that your pet has on its rabies tags for identification purposes and she is wearing a collar and tag with your name and phone number in case of escape. Most pet stores, such as Petco or Petsmart, have machines inside the store where you can make pet ID tags on the spot.

The disparity at 20 oz for Dunkin between a normal and a dark roast is only 65 mg of caffeine, but the disparity at 20 oz for Starbucks between their dark and blonde roast is 135 mg, which is definitely significant.







",1498271138,"That any coffee sold as ""dark roast"" will usually have less caffeine than medium or light roast coffee I only found this out recently, and I feel like it is probably counter intuitive for most people - you would think the darkest, strongest tasting coffee would be the strongest caffeine wise, but it is actually the opposite. 


So if you are looking for a strong caffeine boost, go with the lightest roast available. And if you're looking for a lower caffeine level, go with the dark roast.


I don't think there is actually any scientific reason that this is the case, and the notion that longer roasting times lower caffeine content seems to be a myth, but check out the caffeine content for both Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks:

YouShouldKnow,6d2b4t,YSK that mulch volcanoes kill trees.,"If you're having landscaping done on your property this year, make sure your landscapers don't create ""mulch volcanoes"" around the base of the trees. 

[Example of incorrect mulching](http://i.imgur.com/0zK1LC2.jpg)

mulching your tree like this increases the temperature and water retention around the roots. This aids in the growth of fungi and bacteria that can kill the tree. It also provides a good home for rodents that will chew through the roots of the tree and cause serious damage to it.

Instead, spread the mulch evenly around the base of the tree instead of piling it up near the trunk. Allow the roots to breath.

http://richmondtreestewards.org/education/threats-to-trees/volcano-mulching/",1495634535,"that mulch volcanoes kill trees. If you're having landscaping done on your property this year, make sure your landscapers don't create ""mulch volcanoes"" around the base of the trees. 

[Example of incorrect mulching](

mulching your tree like this increases the temperature and water retention around the roots. This aids in the growth of fungi and bacteria that can kill the tree. It also provides a good home for rodents that will chew through the roots of the tree and cause serious damage to it.

Instead, spread the mulch evenly around the base of the tree instead of piling it up near the trunk. Allow the roots to breath.
